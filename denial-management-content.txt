Pain Points for Denial Management:
1. High Denial Rates - 15-20% of claims denied on first submission, requiring costly rework
2. Lack of Denial Tracking - No systematic tracking means denials go unworked and revenue is lost
3. Ineffective Appeals - Appeals written without payer-specific strategies result in low overturn rates
4. Recurring Denials - Same denial reasons repeat because root causes aren't identified and fixed
5. Resource Drain - Staff spends excessive time on denials instead of preventing them

Testimonial:
"Our denial rate was 18% and climbing when we brought in Medtransic. Their team not only helped us overturn 75% of existing denials, recovering $450,000, but they identified the root causes and reduced our denial rate to under 5%. The impact on our cash flow has been dramatic." - Dr. James Peterson, CFO, Regional Medical Group
