# Netlify Redirects Configuration for React SPA with Prerendering
# This file enables proper SPA routing while serving prerendered HTML when available

# Serve the SPA for all unmatched routes (client-side routing)
# The 200 status means "rewrite" not "redirect", so the URL stays the same
# If a prerendered HTML file exists at the path, it will be served instead
/*    /index.html   200
