# Netlify Redirects Configuration for React SPA with Prerendering
# Note: netlify.toml takes precedence, but keeping this for documentation

# SEO Critical - Serve sitemap and robots directly (configured in netlify.toml)
# These must be served as static files, not SPA routes

# 301 Permanent Redirects - Consolidating duplicate service pages

/services/outsourcing-medical-billing  /services/medical-billing    301

# Serve the SPA for all unmatched routes (client-side routing)
# The 200 status means "rewrite" not "redirect", so the URL stays the same
# Netlify Prerender Extension will serve prerendered HTML to crawlers
