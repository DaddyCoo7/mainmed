('general', 'troubleshooting', 'Why are my claims being rejected at the clearinghouse?',
'Clearinghouse rejections occur from data validation failures before payer submission - systematic diagnosis resolves issues: COMMON REJECTION CATEGORIES - (1) DEMOGRAPHIC ERRORS (25-30% of rejections) - Patient name mismatch (subscriber name on file vs claim different, spelling variations, nicknames vs legal names), date of birth incorrect or missing (transposition errors, wrong format MM/DD/YYYY required), gender mismatch (claim gender vs policy gender different, F vs M error), subscriber relationship incorrect (patient to subscriber - self, spouse, child, incorrect relationship code). Symptoms: rejection codes "patient not found", "demographic mismatch", AAA:56. Resolution: verify patient information with insurance card, match subscriber name exactly as appears on card (no variations), confirm DOB from ID, verify gender, check relationship to subscriber. (2) INSURANCE INFORMATION ERRORS (25-30% of rejections) - Invalid or incorrect payer ID (wrong payer selected, payer ID doesn''t match clearinghouse database, payer name misspelled), member/policy ID incorrect (format wrong, transposition errors, characters vs numbers confusion - O vs 0, I vs 1), group number missing when required (payer requires but not provided, blank field), insurance inactive or terminated (coverage lapsed, effective dates don''t include service date, patient not verified before service). Symptoms: rejection codes "invalid payer", "member not found", "coverage not in effect", AAA:15. Resolution: verify eligibility before service (real-time 270/271), confirm payer ID from clearinghouse payer list, verify member ID from current card, check group number requirement, confirm coverage active for date of service. (3) PROVIDER INFORMATION ERRORS (15-20% of rejections) - Invalid NPI (NPI not found in NPPES, wrong NPI digits - transposition, Type 1 vs Type 2 mismatch, expired or deactivated NPI), taxonomy code missing or incorrect (wrong specialty code, outdated taxonomy, doesn''t match credentials), rendering provider inappropriate (non-physician rendering for physician-required service, credentials insufficient), billing provider not enrolled (clearinghouse enrollment but payer not enrolled, credentialing incomplete). Symptoms: rejection codes "invalid NPI", "provider not found", AAA. Resolution: verify NPI at NPPES database (npiregistry.cms.hhs.gov), confirm correct Type (1 individual, 2 organizational), verify taxonomy code for specialty, ensure provider enrolled with payer, check credentialing status. (4) DIAGNOSIS CODE ERRORS (10-15% of rejections) - Invalid ICD-10 code (code expired or not yet effective, wrong format - decimal missing or wrong position, incorrect specificity - 5th or 6th digit required but missing), age-inappropriate diagnosis (pediatric diagnosis for adult patient, adult condition for child), gender-specific diagnosis on wrong gender (pregnancy code for male patient, prostate condition for female), laterality missing when required (fracture without side specified, eye condition without R/L). Symptoms: rejection codes "invalid diagnosis code", "diagnosis code 9", "specificity required". Resolution: verify current ICD-10 codes (check annual updates October 1), ensure proper format (decimal after 3rd character), add required specificity (4th, 5th, 6th digits), verify age/gender appropriateness, include laterality when required. (5) PROCEDURE CODE ERRORS (10-15% of rejections) - Invalid CPT/HCPCS code (code expired or deleted, wrong format, incorrect code for service), missing or incorrect modifiers (modifier required but not included, wrong modifier for circumstance, modifier position incorrect - some payers order-sensitive), units exceed MUE (Medically Unlikely Edits - max units per date), procedure not valid for place of service (office procedure with inpatient POS, facility service with office POS). Symptoms: rejection codes "invalid procedure code", AAA:16, "MUE exceeded", B16. Resolution: verify current CPT codes (check annual updates January 1), confirm code matches service performed, add required modifiers (59, 25, etc.), check MUE limits, verify appropriate POS code. (6) NCCI BUNDLING VIOLATIONS (8-12% of rejections) - Procedure bundled into comprehensive code (component billed separately when included in global, mutually exclusive procedures billed together), modifier not used to bypass appropriate edit (59, X{EPSU} needed but not included), column 1/column 2 edit violation. Symptoms: rejection codes "bundled procedure", "mutually exclusive", 97, 236. Resolution: review NCCI edits (CMS website or clearinghouse scrubbing report), unbundle appropriately (bill comprehensive code only or component with modifier 59 if documented separately), add modifier to bypass edit when appropriate. (7) MISSING REQUIRED FIELDS (8-10% of rejections) - Required data element blank (diagnosis missing or insufficient, referring provider NPI missing when required, authorization number required but not provided, place of service missing, dates incomplete), situational field required by payer but not provided (onset date for accident, last menstrual period for OB, disability dates for workers comp). Symptoms: rejection codes "required field missing", AAA:15, 16. Resolution: review payer companion guide for requirements, complete all required fields before submission, use clearinghouse validation to identify missing fields, establish EHR templates ensuring completion. (8) DATE-RELATED ERRORS (5-8% of rejections) - Service date in future (date not yet occurred), service before coverage effective (date of service before insurance active), service after coverage terminated, discharge date before admission, from/to date logic errors (to date before from date), date format incorrect (MM/DD/YYYY required). Symptoms: rejection codes "date error", "prior to coverage", 26, 29. Resolution: verify dates carefully (service date, coverage dates via eligibility), check from/to date logic, use correct format, ensure dates chronological. (9) DUPLICATE CLAIM ERRORS (3-5% of rejections) - Identical claim previously submitted (same patient, date, procedure already on file), resubmission without corrected claim indicator (correction not flagged with frequency code 7), original claim still pending. Symptoms: rejection codes "duplicate", 18. Resolution: check claim history before resubmitting, add frequency code 7 for true corrections (corrected claim), wait for original processing (30-45 days) before resubmission, use claim status inquiry (276/277) to verify original status. DIAGNOSTIC PROCESS - STEP 1: OBTAIN DETAILED REJECTION REPORT - Clearinghouse provides rejection details (error codes and descriptions, specific field locations, claim lines affected), review carefully: each error separately, specific rejection reasons, clearinghouse guidance. STEP 2: IDENTIFY ERROR PATTERN - Single claim issue or pattern across multiple claims (if pattern: systemic problem - EHR configuration, template error, payer update not applied, if single: isolated data entry error). STEP 3: RESEARCH ERROR CODE - Look up specific rejection code (clearinghouse knowledge base, payer companion guide, error code reference), understand exact cause and requirement. STEP 4: CORRECT SPECIFIC ISSUE - Based on error category and code, make precise correction: update demographics (verify with patient), correct insurance information (verify with eligibility), fix provider data (verify NPI, taxonomy), update diagnosis codes (current, specific, appropriate), correct procedure codes (valid, with modifiers, within MUE), add missing fields, fix dates. STEP 5: RESUBMIT - Corrected claim resubmitted automatically or manually, monitor acceptance (should pass scrubbing if corrected properly), verify transmission to payer. PREVENTION STRATEGIES - (1) Real-time eligibility verification (before every service or at least at check-in, reduces insurance errors by 50-70%), (2) Front-end data validation in EHR (required field enforcement, format validation, NPI lookup integration, code validation - current CPT/ICD-10), (3) Staff training (common rejection reasons, how to verify information, quality focus at data entry), (4) Comprehensive scrubbing (use clearinghouse advanced scrubbing, specialty-specific rules, payer-specific validation), (5) Regular code updates (quarterly CPT/ICD-10 updates, October 1 ICD-10, January 1 CPT, remove expired codes), (6) Rejection reporting and analysis (weekly rejection reports, identify patterns and trends, target training and process improvements, measure rejection rate - target <5%). CLEARINGHOUSE TOOLS - Error reports with correction guidance (detailed explanations, field-level identification, suggested corrections), enhanced scrubbing rules (catches errors before submission, payer-specific validation, medical necessity checking), claim correction workflow (rejected claims in work queue, integrated correction in EHR, automatic resubmission), knowledge base and support (error code lookup, common issue guidance, customer service for complex issues). WHEN TO ESCALATE - Complex rejections not resolved with standard corrections, payer-specific issues requiring payer contact, clearinghouse technical issues, recurring rejections despite corrections, suspected payer system problems. Escalation: clearinghouse customer support, payer EDI department, vendor technical support if EHR issue.',
'Claims rejected at clearinghouse from: (1) Demographics (25-30%): name/DOB/gender mismatch, verify with card. (2) Insurance (25-30%): invalid payer ID, wrong member ID, verify eligibility. (3) Provider (15-20%): invalid NPI, wrong taxonomy, verify NPPES. (4) Diagnosis (10-15%): expired codes, missing specificity, verify current ICD-10. (5) Procedure (10-15%): invalid CPT, missing modifiers, check MUE. (6) NCCI bundling (8-12%): add modifier 59 if appropriate. (7) Missing fields (8-10%): complete required data. (8) Dates (5-8%): verify coverage dates. (9) Duplicates (3-5%): check history. Resolution: review rejection report, identify error, correct specifically, resubmit. Prevention: eligibility verification, data validation, staff training, current codes. Target <5% rejection rate.',

('general', 'troubleshooting', 'Why is my ERA not posting automatically?',
'ERA auto-posting failures stem from technical, configuration, or data matching issues - systematic troubleshooting restores functionality: ROOT CAUSES OF ERA AUTO-POSTING FAILURES - (1) ERA NOT RECEIVED (15-20% of issues) - ERA enrollment not complete or lapsed (provider not enrolled for 835, enrollment expired, EFT but not ERA enrolled), payer not sending ERA (payer still sending paper EOB, ERA transmission issue, payer system problem), clearinghouse not forwarding ERA (routing issue, account configuration problem, transmission failure), ERA file delivery failure (SFTP connection failed, API error, file not picked up). Symptoms: no ERA file received at all, check clearinghouse portal - no ERA available. Diagnosis: verify ERA enrollment status (with clearinghouse and payer), check clearinghouse portal for ERA files, review ERA delivery configuration, contact payer if enrollment confirmed but no ERA. Resolution: complete ERA enrollment if missing (30-45 days), verify EFT paired with ERA, contact clearinghouse if delivery issue, contact payer EDI department if sending problem. (2) ERA FILE FORMAT INCOMPATIBILITY (15-20% of issues) - Billing system doesn''t support ERA file format (wrong 835 version - 4010 vs 5010, custom format not standard, file structure not recognized), clearinghouse format doesn''t match system expectation (field mapping different, segment order unexpected, proprietary format used), ERA file corrupted (transmission error, incomplete file, format damaged). Symptoms: ERA received but system won''t import, error message "invalid file format", "cannot parse ERA". Diagnosis: check ERA file format specification (835 HIPAA standard version), verify billing system ERA compatibility, review file manually (open in text editor, check ISA segment, verify structure), test with clearinghouse sample file. Resolution: update billing system (to support current 835 version), configure format mapping (clearinghouse may offer multiple formats), request compatible format from clearinghouse, vendor technical support for system compatibility. (3) CLAIM MATCHING FAILURES (30-40% of issues - most common) - Patient account not found (patient name on ERA doesn''t match PM system, account number different or missing, patient merged or archived), claim not in system (claim never entered, claim deleted, date range outside system scope), claim already posted (previous posting, duplicate ERA, posting not recognized), charge information mismatch (procedure code differences, charge amount differences - CPT code on ERA vs system different, date of service doesn''t match exactly, units or quantity mismatch). Symptoms: ERA imports but doesn''t post, claims appear in "unmatched" or "exception" queue, some lines post but others don''t. Diagnosis: review unmatched claim report (most billing systems provide), compare ERA claim identifiers to system (patient name, DOB, account number, claim number, dates of service, procedure codes, charge amounts), identify specific mismatch (name variation, coding difference, date discrepancy). Resolution: patient matching (verify patient name format - last, first vs first last, check DOB and gender match, create matching rules for variations - Jr., Sr., II), claim matching (match by claim control number (most reliable), match by patient ID + date + charge amount, expand date tolerance if needed - +/- 1-2 days, procedure code mapping if different), manual posting for unmatched (post manually and mark posted, investigate systematic issues, improve matching rules). (4) SYSTEM CONFIGURATION ISSUES (15-20% of issues) - ERA auto-posting disabled (setting turned off, requires manual approval, permission issue), payer ID mapping incorrect (ERA payer ID doesn''t match system payer ID, payer not configured in system, payer name variations), posting rules misconfigured (adjustment codes not mapped, payment rules incomplete, default posting logic wrong), user permissions insufficient (staff account doesn''t have auto-post permission, role restrictions). Symptoms: ERA received and matched but doesn''t post, ERA stuck in pending status, no error but no posting action. Diagnosis: check system ERA settings (auto-posting enabled, payer configurations, posting rules and thresholds), verify user permissions (auto-post capability, payer access rights), review system logs (error messages, processing status). Resolution: enable auto-posting (system settings, payer-specific configurations), map payer IDs correctly (ERA payer name to system payer record), configure posting rules (adjustment code mapping - CO, PR, OA codes, payment thresholds, denial routing), grant appropriate permissions. (5) ADJUSTMENT CODE MAPPING PROBLEMS (10-15% of issues) - Adjustment codes not defined (CO, PR, OA codes not in system, new codes not added, payer-specific codes unmapped), incorrect code mapping (codes assigned to wrong category, patient responsibility marked as adjustment or vice versa, writeoff vs billable confusion), conflicting adjustment rules (multiple codes for same adjustment, hierarchy unclear, system can''t determine action). Symptoms: ERA partial posting only (payment posts but adjustments don''t, patient balance calculated incorrectly), adjustment amounts in holding account, error "undefined adjustment code". Diagnosis: review adjustment code mapping (in billing system payer configuration), identify unmapped codes (ERA adjustment report), verify code categories (CO = contractual - writeoff, PR = patient responsibility - billable, OA = other - usually writeoff). Resolution: map all adjustment codes (complete CARC/RARC code mapping, assign proper categories, configure patient responsibility correctly), update codes annually (new CARC codes added regularly, remove obsolete codes), establish defaults (unmapped code default behavior - hold for review recommended). (6) ERA-EFT RECONCILIATION ISSUES (5-10% of issues) - ERA and EFT amounts don''t match (timing differences, multiple ERAs per EFT, ERA subset of deposit), system requires matched deposit before posting (ERA won''t post until reconciled to bank deposit, configuration setting), deposit not recorded (EFT received but not entered in system, bank reconciliation incomplete). Symptoms: ERA received but "awaiting deposit reconciliation", can''t post until deposit matched, partial ERA posting. Diagnosis: compare ERA total to EFT deposit (should match exactly if 1:1, may differ if multiple ERAs), verify deposit recorded in system (bank account reconciliation, deposit batch logged), check reconciliation requirements (system settings). Resolution: reconcile ERA to EFT (create deposit batch matching EFT, assign ERA to deposit, may be automatic or manual), configure reconciliation rules (allow posting before reconciliation if needed, match tolerance settings), post ERAs to holding account (if can''t reconcile immediately, manual reconciliation later). TROUBLESHOOTING WORKFLOW - STEP 1: VERIFY ERA RECEIVED - Check clearinghouse portal for ERA files, verify dates expected vs received, download ERA file if available, determine if delivery issue or posting issue. STEP 2: ATTEMPT MANUAL IMPORT - If not auto-imported, try manual import (most systems allow manual ERA file import), if successful: configuration issue, if fails: format compatibility issue. STEP 3: REVIEW IMPORT LOG - System logs show import attempt, errors and warnings, claims matched vs unmatched, posting results. STEP 4: CHECK UNMATCHED REPORT - Identify claims that didn''t match (patient, claim, charge mismatches), review matching criteria, determine systematic vs isolated issues. STEP 5: VERIFY CONFIGURATION - Auto-posting enabled, payer mapping correct, adjustment codes mapped, reconciliation rules appropriate. STEP 6: TEST SINGLE CLAIM - Select one unmatched claim, verify data exactly matches ERA, attempt manual post to identify issue, resolve specific problem. STEP 7: RESOLVE AND VALIDATE - Implement fix (configuration, mapping, data correction), reprocess ERA or resubmit, monitor next ERA cycles for success. PREVENTION STRATEGIES - (1) Initial setup properly (comprehensive payer configuration, complete adjustment code mapping, test ERA posting before go-live, document configuration), (2) Maintain configurations (update payer IDs when changes, add new adjustment codes, annual CARC/RARC review, software updates maintain compatibility), (3) Monitor ERA processing (daily ERA review, exception report monitoring, matched vs unmatched metrics, investigate failures immediately), (4) Data quality at charge entry (consistent patient naming, accurate charge codes, correct dates, claim numbers tracked), (5) Staff training (how to research unmatched claims, when to manually post vs investigate, escalation procedures), (6) Regular reconciliation (ERA to EFT matching, bank reconciliation current, accounts receivable tie-out). VENDOR SUPPORT - When to engage: format compatibility issues, system configuration complex, repeated failures despite troubleshooting, software bugs suspected, updates needed for ERA version. Provide: sample ERA file, error messages and logs, steps attempted, specific claim examples. METRICS TO TRACK - ERA auto-post success rate (target 90-95%), unmatched claim percentage (target <5-10%), time to resolve exceptions (same-day ideal), ERA processing time (daily recommended).',
'ERA not auto-posting causes: (1) ERA NOT RECEIVED (15-20%): enrollment incomplete/lapsed, payer not sending, delivery failure - verify enrollment, check clearinghouse portal. (2) FILE FORMAT (15-20%): incompatible 835 version, corrupted file - update system, request compatible format. (3) CLAIM MATCHING (30-40%, most common): patient/claim not found, name mismatch, code/date differences - review unmatched report, improve matching rules, check name format. (4) CONFIGURATION (15-20%): auto-posting disabled, payer ID wrong, permissions insufficient - enable settings, map payer IDs, grant permissions. (5) ADJUSTMENT CODES (10-15%): unmapped CARC codes - map CO/PR/OA codes, update annually. (6) ERA-EFT RECONCILIATION (5-10%): amounts don''t match, deposit not recorded - reconcile to EFT. Target 90-95% auto-post rate.',

('general', 'troubleshooting', 'Why is my eligibility verification failing?',
'Eligibility verification failures result from connectivity, data, or payer issues - systematic diagnosis resolves: COMMON FAILURE CATEGORIES - (1) PATIENT DEMOGRAPHIC ERRORS (30-35% of failures) - Name mismatch (subscriber name entered incorrectly, spelling variations vs policy, maiden name vs married name, nickname vs legal name - Bob vs Robert), DOB incorrect (transposition error - month/day swapped, wrong year, typo - 1980 vs 1890), member ID wrong (transposition errors, character confusion - O vs 0, I vs 1, L vs 1, prefix/suffix missing - zeroes, letters, wrong ID type - Medicaid vs commercial), subscriber relationship incorrect (checking dependent as subscriber, wrong relationship selected). Symptoms: "subscriber not found", "demographic mismatch", "invalid member ID". Resolution: verify from current insurance card (front and back), enter subscriber name exactly as appears (no variations), confirm DOB from ID, verify member ID character-by-character, check if patient is subscriber or dependent. (2) PAYER IDENTIFICATION ERRORS (20-25% of failures) - Wrong payer selected (similar payer names confused - Anthem BCBS CA vs Anthem BCBS CO vs Anthem BCBS OH, payer ID incorrect in system, subsidiary vs parent company confusion, state-specific plans mixed up), payer not in clearinghouse network (small regional payer, workers comp carrier, discount plan vs insurance), payer ID outdated (payer merger or name change, system not updated). Symptoms: "payer not found", "invalid payer ID", "transaction not supported". Resolution: verify exact payer name from card, use clearinghouse payer list (search function, verify payer ID), confirm payer type (commercial, Medicare, Medicaid, distinguish insurance from discount plans), update payer IDs after mergers/changes, contact clearinghouse if payer not found. (3) COVERAGE NOT ACTIVE (15-20% of failures) - Coverage terminated (patient no longer has insurance, plan changed and old card used, COBRA expired, employment termination), coverage not yet effective (effective date in future, application pending, waiting period not completed), eligibility check date wrong (checking future date not yet active, checking date outside coverage period). Symptoms: "coverage terminated", "not eligible", "coverage not in effect on date of service". Resolution: verify current coverage with patient, check card effective date, confirm employment status if employer plan, use current date for eligibility check (not future), obtain current insurance information. (4) TECHNICAL/CONNECTIVITY ISSUES (10-15% of failures) - Internet connection problem (network down, timeout, firewall blocking), clearinghouse system issue (maintenance window, temporary outage, processing delay), payer system unavailable (payer EDI system down, scheduled maintenance, high volume causing delays), transaction timeout (response not received within time limit, 30-60 seconds typical, retry may succeed). Symptoms: "connection timeout", "system unavailable", "no response received", intermittent failures. Resolution: check internet connectivity (ping test, other websites accessible), retry transaction (may succeed second attempt), check clearinghouse system status (status page, Twitter/announcements), wait and retry if payer system issue (15-30 minutes), contact clearinghouse support if persistent. (5) ENROLLMENT/CONFIGURATION ISSUES (10-15% of failures) - Eligibility not enrolled (270/271 not included in EDI enrollment, enrollment pending or lapsed, clearinghouse account issue), payer doesn''t support real-time eligibility (some small payers, workers comp carriers, must verify via phone/portal), EHR/PM system misconfiguration (clearinghouse credentials wrong, payer configuration incorrect, transaction routing error, API settings wrong). Symptoms: all payers failing (not payer-specific), "not enrolled", "unauthorized", error messages about credentials. Resolution: verify clearinghouse enrollment includes 270/271 (enrollment status check), confirm payer supports eligibility (clearinghouse payer list indicates support), check system configuration (clearinghouse credentials, API settings, payer routing), test with different payer (isolate system vs payer issue), contact vendor support for configuration. (6) MEDICARE-SPECIFIC ISSUES (5-8% of failures when applicable) - Wrong Medicare Beneficiary Identifier (MBI) used (using old HICN instead of new MBI, transposition error in MBI, using SSN instead of MBI), Medicare Part not specified (Part A, B, C, D - specific part may be required), secondary insurance inquiry needs primary info (Medicare secondary requires primary payer info, coordination of benefits data missing). Symptoms: "invalid Medicare number", "beneficiary not found", "additional information required". Resolution: verify current MBI from card (11 characters, no SSNs on new cards since 2018), specify Medicare Part if required (most outpatient = Part B), include primary insurance if Medicare secondary, use Medicare-specific format requirements. (7) MEDICAID-SPECIFIC ISSUES (5-8% of failures when applicable) - State Medicaid program variation (different ID formats by state, state-specific payer IDs, eligibility check methods differ), Medicaid managed care confusion (need to check plan not state Medicaid, plan-specific ID required, multiple Medicaid plans in state), temporary/emergency Medicaid (pending full approval, limited eligibility window, special verification needed). Symptoms: "member not found in this plan", "check state Medicaid", "managed care plan required". Resolution: verify exact Medicaid plan (managed care vs fee-for-service), confirm state-specific requirements (some require portal not real-time), use plan-specific ID not state Medicaid ID, check state Medicaid portal if real-time not available. DIAGNOSTIC PROCESS - STEP 1: REVIEW ERROR MESSAGE - Read exact error message carefully (specific reason code, description of failure, payer response), screenshot or document for reference. STEP 2: VERIFY PATIENT INFORMATION - Compare entered data to insurance card (name exactly as on card, DOB matches, member ID character-by-character, subscriber relationship correct), check with patient if any uncertainty. STEP 3: ISOLATE ISSUE - Test with different patient/payer (determines if system-wide or patient-specific or payer-specific), test same patient multiple times (intermittent vs persistent), test manual vs automatic eligibility (rules out automation issues). STEP 4: CHECK SYSTEM STATUS - Clearinghouse status (website, portal announcements), payer system status (known issues), internet connectivity (ping, traceroute), recent system changes (software updates, configuration changes). STEP 5: VERIFY CONFIGURATION - Clearinghouse credentials valid, payer selection correct in system, enrollment includes eligibility (270/271), no recent enrollment lapses. STEP 6: CONTACT SUPPORT - Clearinghouse: technical issues, enrollment questions, payer status. Payer: coverage questions, eligibility availability, specific patient eligibility. Vendor: system configuration, software issues. WORKAROUNDS DURING FAILURES - Phone verification (call payer, verify coverage, document conversation - date, time, rep name/ID, info received), payer web portal (online eligibility check, provider portal login, print/save results), manual eligibility inquiry (fax form to payer for small payers, follow up required), collect payment upfront (if cannot verify, patient responsibility agreement, collect deposit or full payment), verify at financial counseling (before expensive procedures, sufficient lead time for alternative verification). PREVENTION STRATEGIES - (1) Front-desk training (how to read insurance cards, common verification mistakes, when to escalate, documentation requirements), (2) Data entry validation (required field enforcement, format checking - DOB, ID, payer lookup assistance, duplicate/similar payer warnings), (3) Automated verification (scheduled batch eligibility - nightly for next day appointments, verify at scheduling, re-verify at check-in), (4) System monitoring (daily eligibility success rate (target 95%+), failure alerts, payer-specific issues, trend analysis), (5) Maintain system (software updates, clearinghouse credential renewal, payer updates after mergers/changes), (6) Patient responsibility (verify current insurance before appointment - call to confirm, bring current card to visit, notify of changes immediately). PAYER-SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS - Some payers require additional information: provider NPI (rendering provider), service type code (specific service or general), subscriber SSN (some payers), additional member identifiers (group number, PCP information). Review payer companion guide or clearinghouse documentation. REAL-TIME VS BATCH - Real-time eligibility (270/271 transactions, immediate response 10-30 seconds, point-of-service verification, single patient at a time), batch eligibility (file of multiple patients, scheduled verification overnight, results available next morning, less immediate but efficient for volume). Both use same 270/271 transaction format.',
'Eligibility verification failures from: (1) DEMOGRAPHICS (30-35%): name/DOB/member ID mismatch - verify exact card info, check subscriber vs dependent. (2) PAYER ID (20-25%): wrong payer selected, similar names confused - use clearinghouse payer list, verify exact name. (3) COVERAGE INACTIVE (15-20%): terminated, not yet effective - confirm current coverage, check effective dates. (4) TECHNICAL (10-15%): internet, clearinghouse/payer system down - check connectivity, retry, check status page. (5) ENROLLMENT (10-15%): 270/271 not enrolled, payer doesn''t support - verify enrollment, check payer support. (6) MEDICARE (5-8%): wrong MBI, old HICN used - verify current 11-character MBI. (7) MEDICAID (5-8%): managed care vs state, plan-specific ID - verify exact plan. Workarounds: phone, portal, manual. Target 95%+ success rate.',

('general', 'troubleshooting', 'Why can''t I get claim status from the clearinghouse?',
'Claim status inquiry failures stem from timing, enrollment, or system issues - understanding claim lifecycle resolves: COMMON STATUS INQUIRY PROBLEMS - (1) CLAIM TOO RECENT (25-30% of issues) - Claim just submitted (status not yet available, clearinghouse processing lag 24-48 hours, payer not yet received), payer hasn''t acknowledged (997/999 acknowledgment pending, 277 claim acknowledgment not yet sent, takes 2-5 days after submission). Symptoms: "claim not found", "no status available", "claim not on file". Resolution: wait appropriate time (24-48 hours after clearinghouse submission, 3-5 days after payer transmission, 7-10 days for initial status from payer), verify claim was actually submitted (check clearinghouse submission report, confirm claim left practice system, review transmission confirmation), check claim acceptance first (was claim accepted by clearinghouse?, did it pass scrubbing?, was it transmitted to payer?). (2) CLAIM STATUS NOT ENROLLED (15-20% of issues) - 276/277 transaction not included in EDI enrollment (enrolled for claims 837 only, eligibility 270/271 but not status, separate enrollment required), enrollment pending or lapsed, payer doesn''t support electronic status (small payers, workers comp carriers, must call for status). Symptoms: all status inquiries fail (not claim-specific), "not enrolled", "unauthorized transaction". Resolution: verify enrollment includes 276/277 (clearinghouse enrollment status, payer-specific enrollment confirmation), enroll for claim status if missing (typically quick addition to existing enrollment, 15-30 days), check payer support for status inquiry (clearinghouse payer capabilities list, some payers don''t support 276/277), use alternative for unsupported payers (phone call to payer, payer web portal). (3) CLAIM IDENTIFIER MISMATCH (15-20% of issues) - Claim number incorrect (clearinghouse claim control number vs payer claim number confusion, transposition error, claim not in system when inquiry submitted), patient information doesn''t match (name, DOB, member ID differs from claim submitted, payer can''t locate claim), date of service mismatch (date entered for inquiry doesn''t match claim, date range too narrow or too broad). Symptoms: "claim not found" for specific claim, other claims retrieve successfully. Resolution: verify claim control number (from clearinghouse submission confirmation, payer claim number if available from prior inquiry), use patient identifying information (exact name as on claim, DOB, member/subscriber ID, date of service range), try alternative search criteria (date range wider, patient ID only without dates, different identifier combinations), confirm claim was actually paid to payer (check payer eligibility - was coverage active?, was claim accepted by payer?). (4) PAYER SYSTEM ISSUES (10-15% of issues) - Payer EDI system down or slow (temporary outage, scheduled maintenance, high volume delays), payer not responding to status inquiries (backlog of 276 requests, system processing delays, payer technical problems), recent payer system changes (migration to new platform, claim data not yet in new system, identifiers changed). Symptoms: specific payer consistently fails (not claim or system-wide), timeout errors, "payer unavailable" messages. Resolution: check payer system status (clearinghouse may post alerts, payer website announcements, contact payer EDI department), wait and retry (15-30 minutes later, payer system may recover, temporary issues common), use alternative methods (call payer for status, payer web portal, IVR phone system), contact clearinghouse (report payer issues, clearinghouse may escalate to payer, confirm if widespread problem). (5) CLEARINGHOUSE CONFIGURATION (8-12% of issues) - Payer routing incorrect (status inquiry sent to wrong payer, payer ID mismatch, similar payer names confused), system configuration error (API settings wrong, 276 transaction format issue, clearinghouse credentials invalid), EHR/PM integration problem (status inquiry not transmitting correctly, response not processing, integration error). Symptoms: consistent failures across claims, error messages about configuration, "invalid transaction" errors. Resolution: verify payer selection correct (clearinghouse payer list, exact payer name matches), check system configuration (clearinghouse credentials current, payer routing configuration, API/integration settings), test manual inquiry (clearinghouse portal direct inquiry, bypasses EHR - if works: integration issue), contact vendor support (clearinghouse technical support, EHR vendor for integration issues). (6) CLAIM ALREADY FINALIZED (5-8% of issues) - Claim paid and closed at payer (status no longer tracked in active system, historical claims not available via 276/277, archived after payment), claim denied and closed (finalized denial, appeals period expired, payer removed from active system), very old claims (status available for 90-180 days only after finalization, older claims not retrievable). Symptoms: "claim not found" for old claim, "claim finalized - no status available". Resolution: check payment history (ERA from payer, bank deposits, already posted in system?), review denial history (was claim denied months ago?, appeal deadline passed?), use alternative for old claims (call payer for historical claims, request claim copy from payer, review EOB/ERA archives), check accounts receivable (is claim showing unpaid in system?, investigate why not posted if paid). (7) TIMING AND PROCESSING STAGES (10-12% of issues) - Claim in payer processing (received but not yet adjudicated, status = "in process" or "pending", normal processing time 14-30 days), claim in medical review (additional review required, status = "pending review" or "more information needed", can take 30-60+ days), claim suspended for additional information (payer requested records, status = "pending information" or "suspended", waiting for provider response). Symptoms: status returns "pending" or "in process", no specific timeframe given, frustration at lack of progress. Response: understand normal timing (14-30 days is normal processing, no status change doesn''t mean problem), check for payer requests (medical records request, additional information needed, outreach letter from payer), follow up appropriately (don''t call daily for in-process claims, follow up at 30-45 days if no status change, respond promptly to information requests). CLAIM STATUS LIFECYCLE - (1) Claim submitted to clearinghouse (Day 0), (2) Clearinghouse scrubbing (Day 0-1), (3) Transmission to payer (Day 1), (4) Payer receipt acknowledgment 997/999 (Day 1-2), (5) Payer claim acknowledgment 277 (Day 2-5) - Status: "received" or "in process", (6) Payer adjudication processing (Day 7-30) - Status: "in process" or "pending", (7) Payer finalization (Day 14-45) - Status: "paid", "denied", "adjusted", (8) ERA sent (Day 14-45). Status inquiry (276) available after step 4-5, may show "received" then "in process" then final status. EFFECTIVE STATUS INQUIRY STRATEGIES - (1) Wait appropriate time before inquiring (48 hours after submission minimum, 7 days for initial payer status, 14-30 days for processing concerns), (2) Use correct identifiers (clearinghouse claim control number best, patient info + date range alternative, payer claim number if available), (3) Understand status codes (received, in process, finalized, paid, denied, common status categories), (4) Escalate appropriately (after 30-45 days with no status change, if "more information needed" not clear, if status seems incorrect), (5) Document status results (date of inquiry, status returned, follow-up date planned, maintains history). ALTERNATIVE STATUS METHODS - When 276/277 not available or not working: payer IVR phone system (automated phone status, enter claim number or patient info, 24/7 available), payer web portal (provider portal login, claim status search, often more detail than 276/277), payer customer service call (speak with representative, complex inquiries, appeals and escalations), clearinghouse portal inquiry (may aggregate status from multiple sources, some have enhanced status features beyond basic 276/277). PROACTIVE CLAIM MANAGEMENT - Don''t wait for patient/provider inquiry: (1) Aged claim reports (review claims >30 days unpaid, status inquiry on aged claims systematically, weekly or biweekly review), (2) Automated status checking (some clearinghouses offer automated 276 for aged claims, alerts when status changes, proactive follow-up), (3) Work queues (claims needing follow-up, status-based work queues - "pending review", "more information needed", assigned to staff for action), (4) Key performance indicators (track days to payment by payer, claims >45 days unpaid percentage, denial rate from status inquiries).',
'Claim status failures from: (1) TOO RECENT (25-30%): just submitted, wait 24-48 hours clearinghouse, 3-5 days payer, 7-10 days initial status. (2) NOT ENROLLED (15-20%): 276/277 not in enrollment, payer doesn''t support - verify enrollment, check payer capabilities. (3) IDENTIFIER MISMATCH (15-20%): wrong claim number, name/DOB different - verify control number, use correct patient info. (4) PAYER SYSTEM (10-15%): down, slow, maintenance - check status, retry later, call payer. (5) CONFIGURATION (8-12%): wrong payer routing, integration error - verify payer, check credentials, test manual. (6) FINALIZED (5-8%): already paid/denied, too old (90-180 days) - check ERA history. (7) PROCESSING (10-12%): normal 14-30 days "in process". Alternatives: IVR, portal, phone call.',

('general', 'troubleshooting', 'What do I do if ERA and EFT amounts don''t match?',
'ERA/EFT mismatches require investigation and reconciliation - systematic approach resolves discrepancies: COMMON MISMATCH SCENARIOS - (1) MULTIPLE ERAs PER SINGLE EFT (40-50% of mismatches) - Payer sends one EFT deposit for multiple payment batches (several days or weeks of claims, consolidated payment, single EFT amount is sum of multiple ERAs), each ERA separate but EFT combined. Scenario: EFT $10,000, ERA #1 $3,500, ERA #2 $4,200, ERA #3 $2,300, Total ERAs = $10,000 matches EFT. Resolution: identify all ERAs for deposit date (check clearinghouse for all ERAs from payer, date range around EFT date, sum all ERA amounts), reconcile total to EFT (all ERAs together should equal EFT, if not: additional ERAs missing or timing difference), post all ERAs (to same deposit batch, links ERAs to single EFT). (2) SINGLE ERA SPANS MULTIPLE EFTs (10-15% of mismatches) - Large ERA payment split across multiple deposits (payer payment limits - $50K or $100K maximums per transaction, ERA $150K might be three $50K EFTs), ERA header shows total, need to match to multiple deposits. Scenario: ERA total $120,000, EFT #1 $50,000, EFT #2 $50,000, EFT #3 $20,000, Total EFTs = $120,000 matches ERA. Resolution: check ERA header information (total payment amount, number of payments, payment method details may list multiple trace numbers), identify corresponding EFT deposits (multiple deposits same day from payer, amounts sum to ERA total), create separate deposit batches if needed (or single batch with multiple deposits, link ERA to all deposits). (3) TIMING DIFFERENCES (15-20% of mismatches) - ERA received before EFT (ERA transmitted immediately, EFT takes 1-2 business days ACH processing, 1-2 day lag common), EFT received before ERA (less common but possible, ERA transmission delayed, system processing delays). Scenario: ERA received Friday $8,500, EFT appears Monday $8,500, amounts match but dates don''t align. Resolution: hold ERA for EFT arrival (if ERA first, wait 2-3 business days for deposit), search for matching ERA (if EFT first, check clearinghouse for ERA, review 2-3 days before and after), reconcile when both received (match by amount and payer, post ERA to EFT deposit). (4) PARTIAL ERA MATCH (10-15% of mismatches) - ERA includes claims from multiple providers (group practice ERA, individual provider EFT, ERA amount greater than single EFT, multiple EFTs to different providers/tax IDs). Scenario: ERA total $15,000, Provider A EFT $9,000, Provider B EFT $6,000, total EFTs = $15,000 matches ERA. Resolution: identify provider-specific payments (ERA shows rendering provider for each claim, tax ID for each payment), separate ERA by provider (split ERA or post appropriately, allocate to correct provider accounts), match each EFT to its portion (Provider A deposit $9K, Provider B deposit $6K, sum equals ERA total). (5) ADJUSTMENTS AND OFFSETS (8-12% of mismatches) - Payer recoupment or offset (previous overpayment recovered, offset against current payment, EFT less than ERA by recoupment amount), ERA shows gross payment (claims adjudicated at $10,000), EFT shows net after offset ($10,000 - $2,000 recoupment = $8,000 EFT). Scenario: ERA total $10,000, EFT $8,000, ERA includes offset line -$2,000. Resolution: review ERA for adjustments (look for negative payment lines, adjustment codes for recoupment - usually OA codes, offset explanation and reference), post ERA fully (includes offset adjustment, patient accounts correct with full ERA, reflects true adjudication), reconcile net to EFT (ERA gross $10K - offset $2K = EFT net $8K, deposit batch shows net amount), research offset if unexpected (contact payer for explanation, verify previous overpayment legitimate, appeal if incorrect). (6) PAPER CHECK WITH ERA (5-8% of mismatches) - ERA received electronically but check mailed (EFT enrollment not complete, payer sent paper check instead of EFT, ERA and check amounts should match). Scenario: ERA $5,000 received, no EFT found, paper check $5,000 arrives 3-5 days later. Resolution: check mail for paper check (check 5-7 days after ERA date, payer may send check not EFT), verify EFT enrollment status (confirm enrolled with payer, check for enrollment lapse, troubleshoot if should be EFT), deposit check manually (physical deposit at bank, longer processing than EFT), post ERA to check deposit (reconcile ERA to check amount, standard posting process). (7) SYSTEM POSTING ERRORS (5-8% of mismatches) - ERA posted incorrectly (wrong amount entered, transposition error, duplicate posting), EFT recorded wrong (bank deposit entered incorrectly, amount typo, duplicate entry), manual posting error. Scenario: ERA $7,500, EFT $7,500, system shows ERA $7,050 or EFT $7,050, source documents correct but system wrong. Resolution: review original documents (835 ERA file - actual total, bank statement - actual EFT, compare to system entries), identify error source (manual entry mistake, system processing error, duplicate entry), correct posting (adjust incorrect amount, remove duplicate, repost if necessary), verify reconciliation after correction. RECONCILIATION PROCESS - STEP 1: GATHER INFORMATION - ERA file (download from clearinghouse, note total payment amount, note date and payer), bank statement (identify EFT deposit, note amount and date, note trace number/reference), clearinghouse remittance report (lists all ERAs received, can search by date range and payer). STEP 2: MATCH BY CRITERIA - Payer (same insurance company), date (within 2-3 days of each other), amount (exact match or logical relationship - multiple ERAs sum to EFT or multiple EFTs sum to ERA). STEP 3: INVESTIGATE DISCREPANCY - If amounts don''t match: look for multiple ERAs or EFTs (sum to total?), check for timing (missing ERA or EFT?), review ERA for offsets (adjustments reducing payment?), verify posting accuracy (system error?). STEP 4: DOCUMENT FINDINGS - Record reconciliation (which ERA(s) match which EFT(s), timing differences noted, offsets identified), maintain supporting documents (ERA files, bank statements, reconciliation worksheets). STEP 5: POST APPROPRIATELY - Link ERA to correct deposit (single or multiple), post adjustments and offsets (reflected in patient accounts), balance deposit batch (ERA total to EFT net if offsets). STEP 6: RESOLVE EXCEPTIONS - Contact payer if can''t reconcile (ERA but no EFT - payment sent?, EFT but no ERA - ERA transmission failed?, amounts can''t be reconciled), contact clearinghouse (missing ERA file, transmission issues), contact bank (EFT not recorded, deposit reversal?). PREVENTION STRATEGIES - (1) Daily reconciliation routine (review ERAs received vs EFTs deposited same day, match as received, don''t let accumulate), (2) Document matching (ERA reference number to EFT trace number, maintain log of ERA-EFT matches, note timing differences), (3) Communication with payer (confirm EFT vs check payment method, understand payer payment cycles, request notification of offsets in advance), (4) System alerts (unreconciled ERAs after 3 days, unmatched deposits, amount discrepancies flagged), (5) Regular training (staff understand reconciliation process, know when to escalate, document thoroughly). TOOLS TO ASSIST - Clearinghouse reconciliation reports (ERA summary by payer and date, EFT matching tools, unreconciled ERA alerts), practice management system (deposit batch reconciliation, ERA-deposit linking, over/under posting alerts), spreadsheet tracking (if automated tools insufficient, manual log of ERAs and EFTs, match status and notes). ESCALATION CRITERIA - Reconcile within 3-5 business days (if can''t match after reasonable time, escalate), significant discrepancies (>$100 or >5% difference, potential error or fraud), repeated mismatches from same payer (systematic issue, payer relationship needed), missing payments (ERA without EFT after 7+ days, EFT without ERA after 7+ days).',
'ERA/EFT mismatch scenarios: (1) MULTIPLE ERAs PER EFT (40-50%): one deposit, several ERAs - sum all ERAs to match EFT. (2) ERA SPANS MULTIPLE EFTs (10-15%): large ERA, payment split - sum EFTs to match ERA. (3) TIMING (15-20%): ERA received before EFT or vice versa, 1-3 days normal - wait for both, then match. (4) PARTIAL (10-15%): group ERA, individual EFTs - split by provider/tax ID. (5) OFFSETS (8-12%): recoupment reduces payment, ERA shows offset line - ERA gross minus offset equals EFT net. (6) PAPER CHECK (5-8%): check not EFT, mail delay 3-5 days - check mail, verify enrollment. (7) POSTING ERROR (5-8%): system entry wrong - verify source documents, correct.

('general', 'troubleshooting', 'How do I fix duplicate claim rejections?',
'Duplicate claim rejections require differentiation between true duplicates and resubmissions: UNDERSTANDING DUPLICATE REJECTIONS - DUPLICATE REJECTION MEANING - Payer or clearinghouse has record of identical claim already submitted (same patient, same date of service, same procedure code(s), within defined time period - typically 90-180 days), system identifies as potential duplicate, rejects to prevent double payment. REJECTION CODES - Common codes: "18" = duplicate claim/service, "duplicate submission" message, "claim already on file", may include date of original submission. TYPES OF DUPLICATE SCENARIOS - (1) TRUE DUPLICATE (30-40% of duplicate rejections) - Claim submitted twice by mistake (staff submitted manually after automatic submission, claim re-exported from EHR without realizing already sent, clearinghouse queue reprocessed, same claim different dates), actual duplication error. Symptom: both submissions truly identical (exact same data, no corrections, no new information). Resolution: STOP - don''t resubmit again, verify original claim status (use 276/277 claim status inquiry, check payer processing or payment status, locate in accounts receivable), if original paid: done, no action needed, post payment if not yet posted, close duplicate alert. If original denied: follow denial process, appeal or correct as appropriate, don''t resubmit duplicate. If original pending: wait for processing, follow up if beyond normal timeframe, don''t submit again. Prevention: check claim history before submission, avoid manual submission if automatic process exists, staff training on duplicate risks. (2) CORRECTED CLAIM NOT FLAGGED (25-35% of duplicate rejections) - Original claim submitted with error, correction made and resubmitted, but frequency code not changed to "7" (corrected claim indicator), payer sees as duplicate not correction. Symptom: claim data changed (different diagnosis code, corrected procedure code, updated charges, different modifier), but flagged as duplicate because frequency not set. Resolution: resubmit with frequency code "7" (corrected claim indicator, also called claim frequency code or submission reason code, located in box 22 on CMS-1500), include corrected data, clearinghouse/payer recognizes as correction not duplicate. Note: provide explanation if requested (what was corrected, why correction necessary, attach documentation if needed). Check EHR/PM system: frequency code field location, default typically "1" (original claim), must change to "7" for corrections, some systems may use "8" (void) then new "1" instead. (3) REPLACEMENT CLAIM NEEDED (15-20% of duplicate rejections) - Original claim needs complete replacement (multiple errors, wrong payer, significant changes, void original and resubmit new), should be voided first then replaced. Resolution: VOID original claim first (frequency code "8" = void/cancel, or contact payer to request void, confirm void processed), submit replacement claim after void (use frequency code "1" for new original, or "7" if continuing from void - check payer preference), wait for void confirmation (before submitting replacement, avoid duplicate period). Note: some payers don''t support electronic void, may require phone call or written request, confirm payer void process. (4) PATIENT HAD MULTIPLE VISITS SAME DAY (10-15% of duplicate rejections) - Legitimate multiple encounters same date (ED visit + admission same day, separate unrelated office visits, different specialties same day), payer system flags as potential duplicate. Symptom: claims are actually different (different service times, different procedures, different diagnosis, different provider/specialty), but same date triggers duplicate alert. Resolution: add modifier to differentiate (modifier 76 = repeat procedure same day by same provider, modifier 77 = repeat procedure same day by different provider, modifier 59 or X{EPSU} = distinct service, different encounter, place of service modifier if applicable), include time of service if available (box 24D time fields on CMS-1500, helps differentiate encounters), documentation (may need to send records, prove separate encounters, explain medical necessity), appeal if wrongly denied (payer should pay both if documented appropriately, provide explanation and documentation). (5) INSURANCE CROSSOVER ISSUES (5-10% of duplicate rejections) - Primary insurance submitted, secondary insurance automatic crossover, secondary flags as duplicate (crossover from primary should be accepted, but system error or timing issue causes duplicate rejection). Symptom: secondary claim rejected as duplicate, primary claim already processed and crossed over (or should have), secondary expected automatic filing. Resolution: verify crossover occurred (check with primary payer - did they send to secondary?, confirm secondary received from primary, timing may be delayed), allow time for automatic crossover (can take 30-60 days, premature secondary submission appears duplicate), manual secondary submission if needed (if primary didn''t cross over after 45-60 days, manually submit with primary EOB attached, note primary payment, may not be flagged duplicate if includes primary EOB), contact payers (confirm primary crossover responsibility, verify secondary received, troubleshoot if crossover failed). (6) TIMELY FILING PRESSURE (5-8% of duplicate rejections) - Approaching timely filing deadline (claim submitted previously but no response, worried about deadline, resubmit "to be safe"), creates duplicate rejection, original may still be processing. Symptom: duplicate rejection but original status unknown, fear of missing deadline motivated resubmission. Resolution: check original claim status first (use 276/277 before resubmitting, confirm received and processing, determine if truly lost), if original received: wait, don''t resubmit (duplicate rejection delays even more, original should process), if original lost: contact payer (request expedited processing, explain timely filing concern, may need supervisor/appeals), document efforts (shows good faith if timely filing becomes issue, phone logs, status inquiry results, dates of contact). (7) SYSTEM GLITCHES (3-5% of duplicate rejections) - Clearinghouse or payer system error (incorrectly identifies as duplicate, matching criteria too broad, system processing issue), claim is unique but system false positive. Symptom: verified claim not previously submitted, all identifiers unique, still rejected as duplicate. Resolution: contact clearinghouse first (report suspected error, provide claim details, clearinghouse may resubmit or override), contact payer if needed (explain situation, request manual review, provide proof of unique claim), documentation (screenshot showing no previous submission, claim history report, support escalation), resubmit if cleared (once clearinghouse/payer confirms not duplicate, system issue resolved). RESOLUTION WORKFLOW - STEP 1: DETERMINE IF TRUE DUPLICATE - Check claim submission history (was this claim submitted before?, when was original submission?, what was status of original?), compare current to previous (is data identical or changed?, if changed: correction needed with frequency 7). STEP 2: RESEARCH ORIGINAL CLAIM - Locate original claim (in practice management system, clearinghouse portal, payer records), determine original status (paid: done, no action needed, denied: follow denial process, pending: wait or follow up, not found: may not be true duplicate). STEP 3: TAKE APPROPRIATE ACTION - Based on scenario: True duplicate: no action, monitor original. Correction: resubmit with frequency 7. Replacement: void then replace. Multiple visits: add modifiers, document. Crossover: verify primary crossover, wait or manual with EOB. Timely filing: check status, contact payer if lost. System error: contact clearinghouse/payer. STEP 4: DOCUMENT RESOLUTION - Note in claim record (duplicate reason identified, action taken, resolution date), attach supporting documentation (status inquiries, payer communications, correspondence). PREVENTION - (1) Claim submission controls (prevent multiple submissions, automatic vs manual separation, submission confirmation checking), (2) Use frequency codes properly (train staff on codes, default to "1" original, "7" for corrections, "8" for voids), (3) Status inquiry before resubmission (always check status, confirm original lost before resubmit, 276/277 before action), (4) System tracking (claim submission log, unique claim identifiers, prevent duplicate export from EHR).',
'Duplicate claim rejection types: (1) TRUE DUPLICATE (30-40%): submitted twice by mistake - check original status, if paid/pending/denied handle appropriately, don''t resubmit. (2) CORRECTED NOT FLAGGED (25-35%): correction without frequency code 7 - resubmit with code 7 (corrected claim indicator). (3) REPLACEMENT (15-20%): needs complete redo - void first (code 8), then submit new. (4) MULTIPLE VISITS SAME DAY (10-15%): legitimate separate encounters - add modifier 76/77/59, document. (5) CROSSOVER (5-10%): secondary after primary - verify primary crossover occurred, wait 30-60 days. (6) TIMELY FILING PRESSURE (5-8%): resubmitted near deadline - check status first (276/277), if received wait. (7) SYSTEM ERROR (3-5%): false positive - contact clearinghouse/payer.

('general', 'troubleshooting', 'What does "invalid NPI" rejection mean and how do I fix it?',
'Invalid NPI rejections indicate provider identification problems requiring verification and correction: NPI REJECTION CAUSES - (1) INCORRECT NPI DIGITS (35-40% of NPI errors) - Transposition error (digits reversed - 1234567890 vs 1234567980, typo during entry, copy-paste error with extra/missing digits), wrong NPI entirely (individual NPI vs organizational NPI confused, provider NPI vs facility NPI mixed up, billing provider vs rendering provider wrong), formatting issues (spaces or dashes included - "1234 567 890" instead of "1234567890", letters instead of numbers - O vs 0, I vs 1). Symptom: "invalid NPI", "NPI not found", "NPI failed validation". Resolution: verify NPI in NPPES database (National Plan and Provider Enumeration System, https://nppesregistry.cms.hhs.gov, search by name or NPI, confirm exact 10-digit number), confirm correct NPI type (Type 1 = individual provider person, Type 2 = organizational entity), enter exactly 10 digits (no spaces, no dashes, no letters), double-check each digit (read carefully, have second person verify for critical submissions). (2) TYPE 1 VS TYPE 2 MISMATCH (20-25% of NPI errors) - Using Type 1 when Type 2 required (billing entity should be organizational NPI, individual provider NPI used instead, group practice requires Type 2), using Type 2 when Type 1 required (rendering provider should be individual, organizational NPI used instead). Symptom: "invalid NPI type", "organizational NPI required", "individual NPI required". Resolution: understand NPI types (Type 1 = individual healthcare provider - physician, NP, PA, therapist, Type 2 = organization - group practice, hospital, clinic, DME supplier, laboratory), billing provider (typically Type 2 organizational NPI if group practice, can be Type 1 if solo practitioner billing under own NPI), rendering provider (always Type 1 individual provider NPI, person who performed service), refer to payer requirements (some require organizational billing NPI even for solo practitioners, companion guide specifications). Example: Dr. Smith works for ABC Medical Group, Rendering Provider NPI = Dr. Smith Type 1 individual NPI, Billing Provider NPI = ABC Medical Group Type 2 organizational NPI. (3) NPI NOT ACTIVE OR DEACTIVATED (15-20% of NPI errors) - NPI expired (provider didn''t maintain NPPES record, contact information outdated, NPI deactivated by NPPES), provider retired or deceased (NPI inactivated, no longer valid for new claims), NPI not yet active (newly assigned NPI, database update lag - takes 24-48 hours). Symptom: "NPI not active", "NPI deactivated", "NPI not found in registry". Resolution: verify NPI status in NPPES (shows active/deactivated, effective date, deactivation date if applicable), update NPPES if needed (provider updates via NPPES website, correct contact information, reactivate if possible), wait if newly assigned (24-48 hours for new NPI to appear in payer systems, delay claims until active), use alternative provider if deactivated (different rendering provider, supervisor/covering provider, incident-to billing if applicable). (4) NPI NOT ENROLLED WITH PAYER (10-15% of NPI errors) - Provider NPI not credentialed (new provider to practice, credentialing application pending or incomplete, payer doesn''t have provider on file), clearinghouse enrollment has NPI but payer enrollment doesn''t (EDI enrolled at clearinghouse level, but payer-specific enrollment missing provider). Symptom: "provider not on file", "NPI not enrolled", "provider not authorized". Resolution: verify payer credentialing status (contact payer provider relations, check credentialing database, confirm effective date), complete credentialing if missing (submit application, provide required documents, 90-120 days for approval typically), verify EDI enrollment includes provider (check clearinghouse enrollment status, add provider to enrollment if missing, 30-60 days for payer update), use alternative provider temporarily (bill under credentialed supervisor if allowed, incident-to billing if applicable, delay billing until credentialing complete). (5) NPI DOESN''T MATCH PAYER RECORDS (8-12% of NPI errors) - Name mismatch (provider name on claim vs credentialing different, spelling variation, maiden name vs married name), taxonomy code mismatch (NPI associated with different specialty in payer system, claim taxonomy doesn''t match credentials, update needed), credentials changed (provider changed specialty, name change not updated with payer, moved from NP to physician). Symptom: "NPI/name mismatch", "invalid NPI for this service", "taxonomy doesn''t match". Resolution: verify information consistency (name on claim exactly matches credentialing, taxonomy code matches provider credentials, all payer records updated), update payer records if needed (submit change forms, provide documentation - marriage certificate, credential letter, 30-45 days for processing), update clearinghouse enrollment (reflect current information, match payer records exactly). (6) NPI IN WRONG FIELD (5-8% of NPI errors) - Rendering provider NPI in billing provider field (or vice versa), referring provider NPI missing or in wrong location (required for some services, wrong position in claim), facility NPI vs provider NPI confusion (place of service requires facility NPI, provider NPI used instead or additional to provider). Symptom: "invalid NPI" but NPI is actually valid, "required NPI missing", "NPI in wrong position". Resolution: understand NPI fields (rendering provider = individual who performed service, billing provider = entity submitting claim and receiving payment, referring provider = provider who referred patient - required for some services, facility = place of service - hospital, SNF - Type 2 NPI), verify claim format (CMS-1500 box locations - box 17 referring provider, box 24J rendering provider, box 33 billing provider, box 32 facility), check payer requirements (referring provider NPI required for PT/OT/DME/lab?, facility NPI required for place of service?), correct field placement (move NPI to correct location, don''t duplicate incorrectly, include all required NPIs). (7) TAXONOMY CODE ISSUES (3-5% of NPI errors) - Missing taxonomy code (required qualifier for NPI, identifies provider specialty/type, claim rejected if missing), wrong taxonomy code (doesn''t match provider credentials, inappropriate for service billed, payer validation failure), outdated taxonomy code (code retired or changed, need current code from NUCC list). Symptom: "invalid taxonomy", "taxonomy code required", "taxonomy doesn''t match NPI". Resolution: find correct taxonomy code (National Uniform Claim Committee NUCC maintains list, http://www.nucc.org, search by specialty/provider type), verify primary taxonomy in NPPES (provider should have primary taxonomy in NPPES record, use same on claims), include on claim (required by most payers, format varies by payer - some electronic submissions, companion guide requirements), update if changed (provider changed specialty, new credentials, update NPPES and payer records). VALIDATION AND VERIFICATION - NPPES DATABASE - Search by NPI or name, verify active status, confirm Type 1 vs Type 2, view provider information (name, credentials, address, taxonomy), check effective date and any deactivation. CLEARINGHOUSE VALIDATION - Most clearinghouses validate NPI automatically during scrubbing (checks against NPPES in real-time, rejects if invalid before payer submission), error report identifies NPI issues specifically. EHR/PM SYSTEM VALIDATION - Configure NPI lookup integration (automated NPPES verification during provider setup, alerts if NPI invalid, prevents incorrect NPI entry), require NPI entry for all providers (no blank NPI fields, validation on claim generation). PREVENTION STRATEGIES - (1) One-time accurate setup (verify all provider NPIs in NPPES during onboarding, enter correctly in EHR/PM system, document Type 1 vs Type 2, include taxonomy codes), (2) Annual verification (review all provider NPIs annually, confirm still active in NPPES, update any changes, remove departed providers), (3) New provider checklist (obtain NPI, verify in NPPES, enter in EHR/PM, complete payer credentialing, verify EDI enrollment, test claim before production), (4) System validation (enable NPI lookup in EHR, validation rules prevent submission with invalid NPI, regular audits of provider data).',

('general', 'troubleshooting', 'How do I resolve clearinghouse connectivity issues?',
'Clearinghouse connectivity problems stem from network, configuration, or authentication failures: CONNECTIVITY ISSUE CATEGORIES - (1) INTERNET/NETWORK PROBLEMS (30-35% of connectivity issues) - No internet connection (network outage, ISP problem, router/modem issue, Wi-Fi disconnected), firewall blocking clearinghouse (ports blocked, security software interference, network policy restriction, corporate firewall rules), bandwidth insufficient (large file uploads timeout, slow connection, network congestion, insufficient speed for real-time transactions). Symptoms: cannot access clearinghouse website, timeout errors, "connection failed", all internet services affected (not just clearinghouse). Diagnosis: test basic internet connectivity (open other websites - Google, yahoo, etc., ping test to external server - ping 8.8.8.8, if fails: network issue not clearinghouse-specific), test clearinghouse website accessibility (can you load login page?, if yes: authentication issue not connectivity, if no: network blocking or clearinghouse down), check firewall and security software (temporarily disable to test - if works: firewall blocking, check security logs for blocked connections, whitelist clearinghouse domains and IPs). Resolution: restore internet connection (restart modem/router, contact ISP if outage, check cable connections, verify Wi-Fi connection), configure firewall (whitelist clearinghouse URLs, open required ports - HTTPS 443, SFTP 22, allow clearinghouse IP addresses, consult IT if corporate firewall), upgrade bandwidth if insufficient (contact ISP for higher speed plan, prioritize medical traffic on network, schedule large transmissions during off-hours). (2) CLEARINGHOUSE SYSTEM OUTAGE (15-20% of connectivity issues) - Clearinghouse down for maintenance (scheduled maintenance window, system upgrades, usually announced in advance, temporary - 1-4 hours typical), unscheduled outage (technical issue at clearinghouse, server problems, high volume overload, security incident), partial outage (specific features unavailable - website accessible but file transmission fails, some payers affected not all). Symptoms: clearinghouse website won''t load or shows error page, transmission failures across all users/locations, multiple payers affected simultaneously, clearinghouse status page shows incident. Diagnosis: check clearinghouse status page (most clearinghouses publish status - status.clearinghousename.com, shows current incidents and scheduled maintenance), check social media (Twitter often used for outage announcements), contact other users (user groups, forums, if others also having issue: likely clearinghouse not local problem), check announcement emails from clearinghouse (scheduled maintenance notifications). Resolution: wait for clearinghouse restoration (monitor status page, typically resolves within hours, prepare alternative if extended - paper claims, other clearinghouse if available), contact clearinghouse support (if unscheduled and unexplained, report issue, request ETA for resolution, escalate if urgent), submit via alternative method temporarily (payer direct portals, paper claims if approaching timely filing, backup clearinghouse if available). (3) AUTHENTICATION/CREDENTIAL PROBLEMS (20-25% of connectivity issues) - Username or password incorrect (typo, caps lock on, password expired, recently changed and not updated in system), account locked (too many failed login attempts, security lockout, suspicious activity flagged, verification required), credentials expired (annual password change required, account renewal needed, subscription lapsed), two-factor authentication issue (code not received, wrong device, time sync problem). Symptoms: "invalid credentials", "login failed", "account locked", can access website but can''t login, API returning authentication error. Diagnosis: verify credentials carefully (username exact - case-sensitive sometimes, password exact - no extra spaces, try manual login to clearinghouse website vs automatic from EHR - isolates credential vs integration issue), check account status (try password reset, check email for account notifications - locked, expired, suspension, contact clearinghouse support for account status), test API credentials if applicable (different from web portal credentials sometimes, API key or token may be separate, verify in EHR configuration). Resolution: reset password (use clearinghouse password reset function, update in EHR/PM system configuration, test login before saving), unlock account (contact clearinghouse support, verify identity, may require security questions or callback), renew subscription/account (pay past-due invoice if lapsed, reactivate account, credentials restored after payment), update credentials in all systems (EHR/PM configuration, any automated processes, backup staff access). (4) INTEGRATION CONFIGURATION ERRORS (15-20% of connectivity issues) - Clearinghouse credentials wrong in EHR (incorrect username/password in system, API key incorrect or expired, trading partner ID wrong), connection settings incorrect (wrong URL/endpoint, wrong server address, port number incorrect, protocol wrong - HTTP vs HTTPS), certificate or SSL issues (security certificate expired, certificate not trusted, SSL handshake failure), EHR software bug (integration broken after update, compatibility issue, vendor bug). Symptoms: EHR can''t connect to clearinghouse, manual clearinghouse login works but automatic doesn''t, "connection refused", "invalid certificate", works for some functions not others. Diagnosis: verify configuration settings (EHR clearinghouse setup page, compare to clearinghouse provided specs - URL, port, credentials, copy-paste credentials to avoid typos), test manual vs automatic (if manual clearinghouse portal works: EHR configuration issue, if neither works: clearinghouse or network issue), check recent changes (software updates recently?, configuration changes?, worked before - when did it stop?), review error logs (EHR error logs, clearinghouse connection logs, specific error codes and messages). Resolution: update configuration (correct credentials in EHR, verify URL/endpoint exact, check port and protocol - HTTPS 443 typical), install certificates if needed (import clearinghouse SSL certificate, trust certificate in system, IT may need to install), contact EHR vendor (if integration issue, vendor support for configuration, software update if bug, technical support for troubleshooting), contact clearinghouse (verify integration specifications current, confirm no recent changes to API/connection method, technical support for testing). (5) TRANSMISSION-SPECIFIC PROBLEMS (8-12% of connectivity issues) - SFTP connection failures (wrong server address, authentication failure, directory permissions, firewall blocking port 22), API rate limiting (too many requests, throttling by clearinghouse, need to reduce frequency), file format errors (wrong file format, encoding problem, corrupted file, clearinghouse can''t process), timeout on large files (file too large, transmission timeout before complete, slow connection for large batch). Symptoms: login works but file won''t transmit, some files go through others fail, timeout errors during transmission, "connection closed", specific to claim submission not login. Diagnosis: test small vs large files (small file succeeds but large fails: timeout/size issue, all fail: connection/authentication issue), verify SFTP settings (if applicable - server address, port 22, username/password, directory path, test with SFTP client - FileZilla), check file size and format (is file very large?, proper format - 837 not PDF?, encoding correct - UTF-8 vs ASCII?), review transmission logs (timing of failure, error codes, retry behavior). Resolution: reduce file size (batch smaller groups of claims, submit more frequently with smaller batches, compression if supported), increase timeout settings (EHR configuration if available, clearinghouse may adjust, network optimization), fix format issues (verify file format correct, check encoding, validate file structure), alternative transmission method (web portal upload vs automatic, manual submission if automatic fails, different protocol if available - AS2 vs SFTP). TROUBLESHOOTING WORKFLOW - STEP 1: IDENTIFY SCOPE - Affects all functions or specific function? (website, claim submission, ERA, eligibility), affects all users/locations or just one? (widespread: clearinghouse/network, single user: local configuration), when did problem start? (after update?, always?, worked before?). STEP 2: TEST CONNECTIVITY - Basic internet (other websites, ping test), clearinghouse website (can load login page?), login credentials (can authenticate?). STEP 3: ISOLATE ISSUE - Test manually (can bypass EHR and use clearinghouse portal directly?), test from different location (different computer, different network), test different functions (if eligibility fails, does claim submission work?). STEP 4: CHECK CONFIGURATION - EHR clearinghouse settings (credentials, URL, port), system requirements (software version, operating system, browser), recent changes (updates, configuration modifications). STEP 5: GATHER INFORMATION - Error messages (exact wording, error codes), screenshots (connection errors, configuration screens), logs (EHR connection logs, clearinghouse transmission logs). STEP 6: ESCALATE - Contact clearinghouse support (provide details, error messages, troubleshooting attempted), contact EHR vendor (if configuration or integration issue), contact IT (if network or firewall issue). PREVENTION - (1) Regular testing (weekly test submission, monitoring automated transmissions, alerting for failures), (2) Documentation (clearinghouse configuration documented, credentials securely stored, escalation procedures), (3) Redundancy (backup internet connection, alternative submission method available, paper claims ready if needed), (4) Monitoring (connectivity alerts, failed transmission notifications, status page monitoring).',
'Clearinghouse connectivity issues: (1) INTERNET/NETWORK (30-35%): no connection, firewall blocking, slow bandwidth - test other sites, ping test, check firewall (whitelist clearinghouse domains/IPs, open port 443 HTTPS, port 22 SFTP). (2) CLEARINGHOUSE DOWN (15-20%): maintenance, outage - check status page, wait for resolution, use alternative temporarily. (3) AUTHENTICATION (20-25%): wrong credentials, locked account, expired - verify username/password exact, reset if needed, update in EHR. (4) CONFIGURATION (15-20%): wrong URL/credentials in EHR, certificate issue - verify settings, test manual vs automatic, update configuration. (5) TRANSMISSION (8-12%): SFTP failure, timeout on large files, format error - reduce file size, check SFTP settings, verify format. Test: website login, then automatic from EHR to isolate.',

('general', 'troubleshooting', 'How do I troubleshoot payer-specific rejections?',
'Payer-specific rejections require understanding unique requirements and systematic resolution: APPROACH TO PAYER-SPECIFIC ISSUES - RECOGNIZING PAYER-SPECIFIC REJECTIONS - Pattern: specific payer consistently rejects claims, other payers accept same claim format, unique error codes or messages not seen with other payers, companion guide requirements. Indicators: payer name in rejection reason, references to payer policy or requirements, error codes specific to that payer. RESEARCH PAYER REQUIREMENTS - (1) COMPANION GUIDE REVIEW (essential first step) - Every payer publishes implementation guide (called "companion guide"), explains payer-specific interpretation of HIPAA standard, details required vs optional fields, specifies formats and codes, provides examples. Location: payer website (provider resources section, EDI documentation), clearinghouse (may provide payer guide links, summary of requirements), EDI department (contact payer for guide). Key sections to review: required fields (beyond HIPAA standard), situational requirements (when certain services, specific format needs - date formats, code requirements, authorization rules), claims processing edits (medical necessity rules, bundling policies, frequency limitations). (2) CLEARINGHOUSE PAYER-SPECIFIC RULES - Many clearinghouses maintain payer rules engines (automatically apply payer requirements, validation beyond basic HIPAA, built into scrubbing process), review clearinghouse payer documentation (payer setup guides, known issues list, tips and requirements). (3) CONTACT PAYER EDI DEPARTMENT - For unclear rejections: call payer provider EDI support (dedicated to electronic claims, can explain specific rejection, clarify requirements), provide: claim example, rejection code/message, specific question. Request: detailed explanation, how to correct, documentation if needed. COMMON PAYER-SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS - (1) AUTHORIZATION NUMBER MANDATORY (15-20% of payer-specific issues) - Some payers require authorization for all specialist referrals, all outpatient procedures, PT/OT beyond limited visits, home health services, DME. Rejection if: authorization number missing (empty field), authorization number format wrong (extra characters, wrong length), authorization expired (date not covered). Resolution: obtain authorization before service (call payer utilization management, online portal authorization request, allow 3-5 days for determination), include on claim (CMS-1500 box 23, electronic submission authorization field, exact number as approved - no variations), verify authorization details (approved dates, approved units/visits, approved procedure codes, approved provider), appeal if clinical necessity supports (letter of medical necessity, supporting documentation, physician peer-to-peer if needed). (2) REFERRING PROVIDER NPI REQUIRED (10-15% of payer-specific issues) - Certain payers mandate referring provider for: physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, DME, laboratory services, imaging studies, specialty consultations. Rejection if: referring provider NPI missing (blank field), referring provider NPI invalid (wrong NPI, not credentialed with payer), referring provider name doesn''t match NPI. Resolution: obtain referring provider information (from patient at intake, call referring provider office if unknown, patient may not remember - check records), include on claim (CMS-1500 box 17 and 17b, electronic rendering provider field, name and NPI both required), verify referring provider credentialed (referring provider must be in payer network sometimes, verify NPI active in NPPES), alternatives if can''t obtain (some payers accept ordering provider instead, PCP on file may work for some payers, contact payer for options if truly unavailable). (3) ONSET DATE OR ACCIDENT INFORMATION (8-12% of payer-specific issues) - Payers require accident details for: injury-related visits, accident diagnosis codes (fractures, lacerations, trauma), workers comp or auto claims, specific diagnosis ranges. Fields needed: accident date (onset date, date of injury), accident type (auto, work, other), accident state (where occurred). Rejection if: accident date missing for injury code, accident type not specified, inconsistent dates (service before accident date). Resolution: obtain accident information from patient (date of injury, type of accident, location), include on claim (CMS-1500 box 10a, 10b, 10c, electronic accident fields, diagnosis requires accident details), ensure consistency (service date after accident date, diagnosis appropriate for accident, documentation supports), appeal if rejected inappropriately (not all diagnosis codes require accident, payer may be overly strict, provide explanation and documentation). (4) PLACE OF SERVICE LIMITATIONS (8-12% of payer-specific issues) - Payers restrict certain procedures to certain locations: office procedures can''t bill with hospital POS, hospital-only procedures rejected with office POS, modifier required for ASC vs hospital, facility vs non-facility rate assumptions. Rejection if: POS inappropriate for code (procedure not covered in that location, payer policy violation), POS doesn''t match provider (office provider with inpatient POS mismatch), modifier needed but missing. Resolution: verify payer POS requirements (companion guide POS policies, payer policy manual, call payer if unclear), use correct POS code (CMS-1500 box 24B, specific code for location - 11 office, 21 inpatient hospital, 22 outpatient hospital, 23 emergency room, etc., match actual service location), add modifier if needed (modifier 25 for same-day E/M, POS-specific modifiers, payer may require for reimbursement), facility fees separate (if facility-based, facility bills separately with appropriate POS, provider bills professional component). (5) FREQUENCY LIMITATIONS (5-8% of payer-specific issues) - Payers limit frequency of certain services: once per year (preventive services, screenings), once per condition (PT evaluation), specific time periods (every 30 days, every 6 months), medical necessity for more frequent. Rejection if: service too soon after previous (denied as "frequency exceeded", too frequent for policy, date restriction), no medical necessity documentation (more frequent than allowed, need documentation supporting). Resolution: verify payer frequency policies (preventive services schedules, procedure-specific limits, medical policy bulletins), check patient history (when was last service?, within restricted period?, can delay until allowed?), document medical necessity (if more frequent needed, include diagnosis supporting, attach notes explaining necessity, appeal with physician explanation), delay service if possible (wait until policy allows, reschedule patient, alternative treatment temporarily). (6) DIAGNOSIS-PROCEDURE PAIRING (5-8% of payer-specific issues) - Payers require specific diagnoses for certain procedures: screening requires screening diagnosis (not symptom), specific ICD-10 ranges for specific procedures (diabetic supplies require diabetes diagnosis), diagnosis must support medical necessity (procedure appropriate for condition). Rejection if: diagnosis doesn''t support procedure (medical necessity not established, inappropriate pairing), wrong diagnosis type for service (preventive code for diagnostic procedure or vice versa), multiple diagnoses but wrong pointer (procedure linked to wrong diagnosis on claim). Resolution: review payer medical necessity policies (LCD - Local Coverage Determination, NCD - National Coverage Determination, coverage policies by service), ensure appropriate diagnosis (diagnosis supports medical necessity, screening vs diagnostic distinction, specific enough - not unspecified codes), correct diagnosis pointer (link procedure to supporting diagnosis - multiple diagnoses on claim, pointer references correct one, primary diagnosis not always the supporting diagnosis), documentation (physician note supports diagnosis, diagnosis explains need for procedure). (7) MODIFIER REQUIREMENTS (5-8% of payer-specific issues) - Payers require specific modifiers: 25 for E/M same day as procedure, 59 or X{EPSU} for unbundling, 76/77 for repeat procedures, payer-specific modifiers for certain situations. Rejection if: modifier missing when required (claim bundles or denies without modifier, medical necessity not established), incorrect modifier (wrong modifier for situation, order of modifiers matters for some payers), excessive modifiers (too many modifiers confusing, unclear purpose). Resolution: review NCCI edits and payer bundling (CMS NCCI tables online, clearinghouse scrubbing report, understand bundling for codes billed), add appropriate modifier (modifier 25 for significant separately identifiable E/M, modifier 59 for distinct service, modifier 76/77 for repeat service, X{EPSU} modifiers more specific than 59 - XE different encounter, XS separate structure, XP separate practitioner, XU unusual non-overlapping), verify modifier order (some payers order-sensitive - pricing modifier first, informational modifier second, check companion guide), document appropriately (modifier 25 requires separately identifiable documentation, modifier 59 requires distinct service documentation). (8) CLAIM ATTACHMENT REQUIREMENTS (3-5% of payer-specific issues) - Some payers require documentation: all unlisted codes (documentation explaining service), high-dollar claims (medical records), new procedures (description and necessity), specific procedures (operative reports, radiology images). Rejection if: documentation not submitted (attachment required but not sent, payer suspended for records), attachment format wrong (wrong format - PDF vs other, file size too large), insufficient documentation (doesn''t explain service adequately, doesn''t support medical necessity). Resolution: identify attachment requirements (companion guide specifies, payer request letter, payer portal requirements), submit documentation properly (clearinghouse attachment method - some support electronic, some require separate submission, payer portal upload, mail/fax with claim reference if electronic not supported), include adequate documentation (operative report for surgical procedures, medical records for medical necessity, letter of explanation for unlisted codes, all relevant pages). PAYER RESEARCH RESOURCES - Payer website (provider manual, medical policies, companion guide, EDI documentation), clearinghouse knowledge base (payer-specific tips, rejection explanations, community forums), payer EDI support (phone support for EDI questions, email inquiries, technical support representatives), industry groups (MGMA, HBMA have resources, specialty society billing guidance), consultant or billing company (experienced with specific payer, knows common issues and solutions). RESOLUTION WORKFLOW - (1) Identify payer-specific pattern (multiple rejections from same payer), (2) Review rejection details (exact error code and message, specific fields referenced), (3) Research payer requirements (companion guide review, clearinghouse documentation, payer EDI contact), (4) Identify specific requirement missed (authorization, referring provider, diagnosis pairing, modifier, etc.), (5) Correct claim appropriately (add missing info, correct format, include documentation), (6) Resubmit claim (with corrections, monitor acceptance), (7) Document for future (add to payer checklist, train staff on requirement, configure EHR if possible to enforce), (8) Appeal if inappropriate (if rejection wrong, payer error, appeal with explanation and documentation).',
'Payer-specific rejections: research companion guide (implementation guide on payer website or from clearinghouse), review payer requirements, contact payer EDI department. COMMON REQUIREMENTS: (1) Authorization mandatory (15-20%): obtain before service, include number box 23. (2) Referring provider NPI (10-15%): PT/OT/DME/lab/imaging require, box 17 and 17b. (3) Onset date/accident info (8-12%): injury codes require, box 10a/10b/10c. (4) POS limitations (8-12%): procedure restricted to location, verify policy.

('general', 'troubleshooting', 'How do I fix EHR-clearinghouse integration failures?',
'Integration failures between EHR and clearinghouse require systematic diagnosis of connectivity, configuration, and data exchange: INTEGRATION FAILURE CATEGORIES - (1) CONNECTION FAILURES (25-30% of integration issues) - EHR can''t reach clearinghouse (network connectivity issue, internet down, firewall blocking, VPN disconnected if required), authentication fails (credentials wrong in EHR, clearinghouse password changed, API key expired, clearinghouse account suspended). Symptoms: "connection timeout", "unable to connect", "authentication error", "host not found", all clearinghouse functions fail from EHR. Diagnosis: test basic connectivity (can access clearinghouse website manually?, other internet services working?, ping clearinghouse URL), verify credentials (login to clearinghouse portal directly, are credentials correct?, recently changed?, try same credentials manually - if works: EHR configuration issue), check EHR configuration (clearinghouse setup page in EHR, URL correct?, credentials entered correctly?, API endpoint correct?). Resolution: restore network connectivity (troubleshoot internet connection, check firewall allowing clearinghouse - whitelist domains/IPs, restart router/modem if needed), update credentials in EHR (clearinghouse configuration page, enter correct username/password/API key, test connection after update), verify API still active (contact clearinghouse if API access lost, reactivate subscription if lapsed, generate new API key if expired), contact vendor support (EHR vendor for configuration help, clearinghouse for API technical support). (2) ONE-DIRECTIONAL FAILURE (20-25% of integration issues) - Claims submit successfully but ERA doesn''t return (outbound works, inbound fails, ERA enrollment issue or return path problem), eligibility works but claims fail (some functions work, others don''t, selective failure), specific transaction types fail (837 works but 270/271 fails). Symptoms: partial functionality, can send but not receive (or vice versa), specific features not working while others do. Diagnosis: test each function separately (claim submission - success?, eligibility - success?, ERA retrieval - success?, claim status - success?), identify pattern (inbound vs outbound, specific transaction types, certain payers only), check enrollment (is failing transaction enrolled?, 270/271 separate from 837, ERA separate enrollment). Resolution: verify bidirectional configuration (EHR configured for inbound and outbound, result pickup configured - ERA retrieval path, acknowledgment processing enabled), complete missing enrollment (ERA enrollment if not receiving remittance, eligibility enrollment if 270/271 fails, verify all transaction types in enrollment status), configure return path (ERA delivery method - SFTP, API, download, file location for pickup, EHR retrieval schedule), contact support (clearinghouse verify inbound working, EHR vendor verify retrieval configured, test inbound delivery). (3) DATA MAPPING ERRORS (15-20% of integration issues) - Field mapping incorrect (EHR field doesn''t map correctly to 837 element, data in wrong position, clearinghouse can''t interpret), required fields missing (EHR not populating required 837 field, template incomplete, data not flowing from EHR), format incompatibility (date format wrong, code format issue, character encoding problem). Symptoms: claims rejected for data errors, specific fields consistently wrong, format validation failures, claims look correct in EHR but clearinghouse rejects. Diagnosis: review rejection report (which fields causing errors?, consistent pattern?, all claims or specific situations?), compare EHR output to 837 standard (export claim file from EHR, open in text editor, review segments and elements, verify correct format and positions), test with clearinghouse validation tool (many clearinghouses offer file validator, upload claim file, identifies format issues before submission). Resolution: correct field mapping (EHR configuration or vendor support, map EHR fields to correct 837 elements, verify required fields populated), update claim templates (ensure all required fields included, default values where appropriate, mandatory field enforcement), fix format issues (date format MM/DD/YYYY, NPI without dashes or spaces, amounts with decimal - 100.00), contact EHR vendor (if mapping issue in standard interface, vendor fixes in update, workaround until fixed), create custom mapping (some EHRs allow custom 837 mapping, configure for clearinghouse/payer needs). (4) VERSION MISMATCH (10-15% of integration issues) - EHR using old 837 version (4010 format when 5010 required, older version not accepted, clearinghouse upgraded but EHR not), clearinghouse expecting different format (proprietary format vs standard 837, custom implementation), unsupported transaction version. Symptoms: "invalid transaction version", "wrong format version", format errors, worked previously but stopped after clearinghouse update. Diagnosis: check EHR 837 version (EHR system info or vendor, 5010 is current standard since 2012, 4010 obsolete), verify clearinghouse requirements (clearinghouse documentation, accepted versions, migration announcements), review recent changes (EHR updated?, clearinghouse updated?, stopped working after change?). Resolution: update EHR to current version (software update from vendor, may require upgrade/repurchase, 5010 compliance essential), verify clearinghouse supports EHR version (if EHR very old, clearinghouse may not support, contact clearinghouse for compatibility), consider EHR replacement (if vendor no longer supports updates, system obsolete, invest in modern EHR). (5) INTERMITTENT FAILURES (10-15% of integration issues) - Works sometimes, fails others (inconsistent, no clear pattern, may be timing-related), timeouts during high volume (batch processing fails, small batches work, large files fail), synchronization issues (timing of processes, race condition, delayed processing causes failure). Symptoms: unpredictable failures, works sometimes fails others, large files or batches fail, time-of-day pattern, retry often works. Diagnosis: identify pattern (time of day?, volume of claims?, size of file?, specific data patterns?), test with small batches (single claim works?, 10 claims?, 100 claims?, determine threshold), monitor clearinghouse status (high volume periods?, system slow?, scheduled maintenance windows?), check timeout settings (is EHR timing out before clearinghouse responds?, configurable timeout?). Resolution: adjust batch size (submit smaller batches, more frequent submissions, stay under failure threshold), increase timeout (EHR configuration if available, allow more time for response, especially for large files), schedule submissions (avoid peak hours if clearinghouse slow, overnight processing for large batches, spread throughout day), optimize data (remove unnecessary characters, validate before submission, reduce file size if possible), contact clearinghouse (report intermittent issues, may be clearinghouse capacity issue, request investigation). (6) AFTER SOFTWARE UPDATE (8-12% of integration issues) - Worked before EHR update (integration broke after EHR version upgrade, new EHR version changed integration, regression bug), worked before clearinghouse change (clearinghouse system migration, API changes, new requirements), configuration lost (update reset configuration, credentials wiped, need to reconfigure). Symptoms: worked previously, stopped after recent update, recent software change, "worked yesterday" scenario. Diagnosis: identify recent changes (EHR updated recently?, clearinghouse announced changes?, staff changed settings?), check configuration (settings still present?, credentials still entered?, test connection), review release notes (EHR vendor release notes for integration changes, clearinghouse announcements for API updates), test previous functionality (is it completely broken or partially working?, what specific features affected?). Resolution: reconfigure after update (re-enter credentials if lost, verify all settings, test connection and functions), apply patch/hotfix (EHR vendor may release fix for integration bug, clearinghouse may provide updated API specs, apply promptly), rollback if necessary (revert to previous EHR version if critical issue, temporary until fix available, coordinate with vendor), contact vendors (report regression bug, both EHR and clearinghouse if unclear source, request priority fix if critical). (7) SPECIFIC PAYER PROBLEMS (5-8% of integration issues) - All payers work except one (specific payer routing issue, payer not in clearinghouse network for EHR integration, payer-specific configuration needed), specific payer enrollment issue (enrolled at clearinghouse but not integrated for EHR, routing misconfigured, payer ID wrong). Symptoms: most claims process successfully, one payer consistently fails, payer-specific error messages, works manually but not from EHR integration. Diagnosis: isolate to specific payer (test with multiple payers, identify which work and which don''t, pattern to failed payers?), test manual submission (can submit to payer via clearinghouse portal?, if yes: integration routing issue, if no: enrollment or payer issue), verify payer configuration (EHR payer setup, clearinghouse payer ID, payer routing). Resolution: verify payer ID mapping (EHR payer ID matches clearinghouse payer ID, no typos or mismatches, spelling exact), complete payer-specific configuration (some payers require special setup in EHR, companion guide requirements, additional fields), verify enrollment (payer enrolled at clearinghouse?, specific to integration?, contact clearinghouse verify), retest and monitor (after configuration changes, submit test claim, monitor ongoing). TROUBLESHOOTING WORKFLOW - (1) Identify symptoms (what''s failing?, all functions or specific?, all payers or specific?, error messages?), (2) Test manual vs integration (can bypass EHR and use clearinghouse portal?, if manual works: EHR integration issue, if manual fails: clearinghouse or enrollment issue), (3) Review configuration (EHR clearinghouse settings, credentials, mappings, recent changes), (4) Check logs (EHR error logs - connection attempts, errors, clearinghouse transmission logs, error codes and messages), (5) Test isolated functions (submission, retrieval, specific transactions, specific payers), (6) Gather error details (exact error messages, screenshots, log entries, timestamps), (7) Contact support (EHR vendor for EHR issues, clearinghouse for clearinghouse issues, both if unclear, provide details gathered). PREVENTION - (1) Document configuration (clearinghouse settings documented, credentials backed up securely, configuration screenshots), (2) Test after updates (verify integration after EHR updates, test all functions - submit, retrieve, eligibility, monitor first days after update), (3) Monitor integration (daily verification claims transmitting, ERA receiving, alerts for failures), (4) Maintain vendor relationships (responsive support contacts, escalation paths, vendor notifications of changes).',
'EHR-clearinghouse integration failures: (1) CONNECTION (25-30%): can''t reach clearinghouse, authentication fails - test manual login to clearinghouse, verify credentials in EHR, check firewall/network, update credentials. (2) ONE-DIRECTIONAL (20-25%): claims work but ERA doesn''t, or vice versa - verify bidirectional config, complete missing enrollment (ERA separate), configure return path. (3) DATA MAPPING (15-20%): fields in wrong position, required fields missing - review rejections, correct mapping, update templates, contact EHR vendor.
