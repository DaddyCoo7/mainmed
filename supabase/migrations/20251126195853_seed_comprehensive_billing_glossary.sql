('Account Receivable (A/R)', 'Money owed to a healthcare provider for services rendered but not yet paid.', 'Accounts receivable represents the total outstanding balance from patients and insurance companies. It includes all billed claims that are awaiting payment, whether from primary insurance, secondary insurance, or patient responsibility. Effective A/R management is critical for maintaining positive cash flow and financial health. The A/R aging report categorizes outstanding balances by time periods (0-30 days, 31-60 days, 61-90 days, 90+ days) to help identify collection priorities and potential problem accounts.', 'A medical practice has $150,000 in total A/R, with $100,000 from insurance companies and $50,000 from patient balances. Of this, $120,000 is current (0-30 days), $20,000 is 31-60 days old, and $10,000 is over 90 days old.', 'Poor A/R management can severely impact cash flow and practice viability. Days in A/R is a key performance indicator, with best practices targeting 30-40 days. Higher A/R days indicate collection problems, claim denials, or inefficient billing processes that require immediate attention.', 'Billing Process', ARRAY['Aging Report', 'Clean Claim Rate', 'Revenue Cycle Management', 'Collection Rate']),

('Adjustment', 'A reduction in the amount charged for a medical service, typically due to contractual agreements with insurance companies.', 'Adjustments represent the difference between what a provider charges and what they are contractually obligated to accept as payment. There are several types: contractual adjustments (required by payer contracts), courtesy adjustments (provider discretion for patient hardship), small balance write-offs, and administrative adjustments (billing errors). Adjustments must be properly coded and documented for accounting, compliance, and financial reporting purposes. Excessive adjustments may indicate pricing strategy problems or contract negotiation issues.', 'A provider charges $500 for a procedure. The insurance company has a contracted rate of $350. The provider must take a $150 contractual adjustment and cannot bill the patient for this amount (unless it''s an out-of-network situation).', 'Understanding adjustments is essential for accurate revenue forecasting and financial analysis. Large adjustment amounts may indicate the need for fee schedule updates or payer contract renegotiation. Improper adjustments can lead to compliance issues or lost revenue.', 'Financial Terms', ARRAY['Allowed Amount', 'Contractual Allowance', 'Write-off', 'Fee Schedule']),

('Authorization', 'Pre-approval from an insurance company required before certain medical services can be performed and covered.', 'Also called prior authorization or pre-certification, this is a utilization management tool used by payers to control costs and ensure medical necessity. Authorization requirements vary by payer, plan, and service type. Common services requiring authorization include: advanced imaging (MRI, CT), surgery, specialty medications, durable medical equipment, and specialist consultations. The authorization process typically requires submitting clinical documentation to justify medical necessity. Failure to obtain required authorizations often results in claim denials and financial responsibility issues. Tracking authorization expiration dates and approved units/visits is critical.', 'Before scheduling a patient for an MRI, the provider''s office contacts the insurance company, submits clinical notes explaining the medical necessity, and receives an authorization number valid for 30 days and covering one MRI scan. This number must be included on the claim submission.', 'Services performed without proper authorization may not be reimbursed, creating significant financial losses and potential patient balance billing issues. Authorization requirements are a leading cause of claim denials and patient dissatisfaction. Efficient authorization management improves revenue capture and patient experience.', 'Insurance Terms', ARRAY['Medical Necessity', 'Precertification', 'Utilization Management', 'Claim Denial']),

('Batch Posting', 'The process of posting multiple payments or adjustments simultaneously as a group.', 'Batch posting is an efficient method for processing multiple payments received together, such as an ERA (Electronic Remittance Advice) from an insurance company containing hundreds of claim payments. Modern practice management systems can automatically post entire ERA batches with matching claim details. The batch is reviewed for accuracy before final posting. Any exceptions or unmatched payments require manual intervention. Batch posting improves efficiency compared to individual payment posting but requires careful review to prevent errors. Proper batch balancing ensures all payments are accounted for and correctly applied.', 'A practice receives an ERA from Blue Cross Blue Shield containing 250 claim payments totaling $85,000. The billing staff reviews the ERA, verifies the payments match expected amounts, and posts the entire batch at once rather than manually entering 250 individual payments.', 'Batch posting significantly reduces manual data entry time and human error in the payment posting process. However, automated batch posting still requires oversight to catch processing errors, incorrect payment amounts, or missing claims that could indicate larger issues with claim submissions or payer processing.', 'Billing Process', ARRAY['ERA', 'Payment Posting', 'EOB', 'Reconciliation']),

('Charge Capture', 'The process of recording all billable services provided to patients to ensure proper billing.', 'Charge capture is a critical first step in the revenue cycle, ensuring that every billable service, procedure, supply, and provider encounter is documented and submitted for billing. This includes professional services (E/M codes), procedures (CPT codes), supplies (HCPCS codes), and ancillary services. Incomplete charge capture directly reduces revenue. Common capture methods include: paper charge tickets, electronic charge capture (integrated with EHR), and automated rules-based capture. Best practices include real-time charge entry, charge validation against documentation, and regular charge reconciliation. Missed charges are one of the largest sources of revenue leakage in healthcare.', 'A surgeon performs a procedure and also provides post-operative consultation on the same day. Both services must be captured with appropriate codes and modifiers. The surgical procedure is captured with a CPT code, and the consultation is captured with an E/M code plus modifier 25 to indicate a separately identifiable service.', 'Studies show that hospitals and practices lose 1-5% of revenue due to incomplete or inaccurate charge capture. Improved charge capture processes directly impact the bottom line and ensure providers are compensated for all services rendered. Integration between clinical and billing systems enhances charge capture accuracy.', 'Billing Process', ARRAY['CPT Code', 'Charge Entry', 'Revenue Leakage', 'Encounter Form']),

('Clean Claim', 'A claim submitted to an insurance payer that contains no errors, omissions, or other issues that would prevent immediate processing.', 'A clean claim includes all required patient demographics, insurance information, appropriate diagnosis and procedure codes, valid authorization numbers when required, and proper modifier usage. Clean claims pass all payer edits and can be auto-adjudicated without manual review. Industry benchmarks target a 95%+ clean claim rate. Common reasons claims are not clean include: missing or invalid insurance information, incorrect or incomplete diagnosis codes, missing authorization numbers, coding errors, or mismatched patient demographics. Real-time claim scrubbing technology can identify and correct issues before submission.', 'A provider submits 100 claims to Medicare. Of these, 96 are processed immediately and paid within 14 days (clean claims). The remaining 4 are rejected for issues like missing diagnosis codes or invalid procedure codes, requiring correction and resubmission, delaying payment by 30+ days.', 'Clean claim rates are a critical KPI for revenue cycle performance. Higher clean claim rates mean faster payment, reduced denials, lower administrative costs, and better cash flow. Improving clean claim rates from 90% to 95% can reduce days in A/R by 5-10 days and significantly decrease rework costs.', 'Claims & Denials', ARRAY['Claim Scrubbing', 'Claim Rejection', 'First Pass Resolution Rate', 'Auto-adjudication']);

-- INSURANCE TERMS
INSERT INTO glossary_terms (term, definition, detailed_explanation, example, why_it_matters, category, related_terms) VALUES
('Allowed Amount', 'The maximum amount an insurance company will reimburse for a covered service based on their fee schedule or contract.', 'The allowed amount (also called approved amount, eligible expense, or negotiated rate) is determined by the insurance contract between the payer and provider. For in-network providers, this is the contracted rate. For out-of-network providers, it may be based on usual, customary, and reasonable (UCR) charges or a percentage of Medicare rates. The allowed amount is applied before patient cost-sharing calculations. The provider must accept the allowed amount as payment in full for covered services (for in-network care) and cannot balance bill the patient for the difference between charges and allowed amount, except for applicable deductible, coinsurance, or copay.', 'A provider bills $800 for a service. The insurance company''s allowed amount for in-network providers is $500. After the patient''s $100 copay, the insurance pays $400. The provider must write off the $300 difference between the billed charge ($800) and allowed amount ($500) as a contractual adjustment.', 'Understanding allowed amounts is crucial for financial planning, fee schedule management, and contract negotiation. Providers must ensure their fee schedules are above payer allowed amounts to avoid leaving money on the table. Tracking the gap between charges and allowed amounts helps identify opportunities for contract renegotiation or fee schedule optimization.', 'Insurance Terms', ARRAY['Adjustment', 'Fee Schedule', 'Contractual Allowance', 'UCR']),

('Coinsurance', 'The percentage of covered medical costs that a patient must pay after meeting their deductible.', 'Coinsurance is a form of cost-sharing where the patient pays a fixed percentage (commonly 20%, 30%, or 40%) of the allowed amount, and the insurance pays the remaining percentage. Coinsurance applies after the deductible is met and continues until the out-of-pocket maximum is reached. For example, an 80/20 plan means insurance pays 80% and the patient pays 20% of covered services. Coinsurance amounts vary by service type and whether providers are in-network or out-of-network. High-deductible health plans often have higher coinsurance percentages. Calculating coinsurance accurately is essential for correct patient billing.', 'A patient has met their $2,000 deductible and has an 80/20 coinsurance plan. They receive a covered service with an allowed amount of $1,000. The insurance pays $800 (80%), and the patient owes $200 (20%) as coinsurance. If the service was provided before meeting the deductible, the patient would owe the full $1,000.', 'Accurate coinsurance calculation prevents patient billing disputes and collection issues. Patients often don''t understand the difference between copayments and coinsurance, requiring clear communication. Collecting coinsurance at time of service improves collections, as post-service collection rates drop significantly. Understanding coinsurance structures helps with accurate patient estimates.', 'Financial Terms', ARRAY['Deductible', 'Copayment', 'Out-of-Pocket Maximum', 'Cost Sharing']),

('Coordination of Benefits (COB)', 'The process of determining which insurance plan pays first when a patient has coverage from multiple sources.', 'COB prevents duplicate payments and determines the order of payment when a patient has more than one insurance plan. Common scenarios include: dual coverage through two working spouses, Medicare plus supplemental insurance, or coverage through both a parent and employer. The primary insurance pays first according to its benefits, then remaining balances are submitted to the secondary insurance. COB rules follow the "birthday rule" for dependent children (parent with earliest birth month/day in the year is primary) or other specific regulations for Medicare, workers'' compensation, or auto insurance. Proper COB prevents claim rejections and delays.', 'A child is covered under both parents'' health insurance plans. The father''s birthday is March 15, and the mother''s is July 8. Under the birthday rule, the father''s plan is primary. A $500 claim is submitted to the father''s plan first, which pays $400. The remaining $100 is then submitted to the mother''s plan (secondary) for consideration.', 'Incorrect COB is a leading cause of claim denials and payment delays. Verifying all insurance coverage at registration and updating COB information prevents rejections. When COB is incorrectly identified, claims may be rejected by both payers, requiring correction and resubmission, significantly delaying payment and increasing administrative costs.', 'Insurance Terms', ARRAY['Primary Insurance', 'Secondary Insurance', 'Birthday Rule', 'Dual Coverage']),

('Copayment (Copay)', 'A fixed dollar amount a patient pays for a covered service, usually collected at the time of service.', 'Copayments are predetermined fixed amounts specified in the insurance policy, such as $25 for a primary care visit or $50 for a specialist visit. Copays are typically collected at check-in and do not count toward the deductible (though they do count toward the out-of-pocket maximum in most plans). Copay amounts vary by service type: office visits, emergency room, urgent care, prescriptions, and other services each have specific copay amounts. Some services may be copay-exempt (like preventive care). Copays are a cost-sharing mechanism to reduce unnecessary utilization. They are separate from coinsurance and deductibles.', 'A patient has a $30 copay for primary care visits. When they arrive for their appointment, the front desk collects $30. Later, the provider submits a claim for $150 to the insurance company. The insurance pays the practice based on the contracted rate minus the copay already collected, and the patient owes no additional amount (unless there are non-covered services).', 'Collecting copays at time of service is critical for cash flow and reduces bad debt. Studies show post-service collection rates drop to 50-70%, while point-of-service collection approaches 100%. Front desk staff must be trained to collect copays consistently and verify copay amounts in real-time via eligibility checks, as copay amounts can vary by appointment type and insurance plan.', 'Financial Terms', ARRAY['Coinsurance', 'Deductible', 'Cost Sharing', 'Patient Responsibility']),

('Deductible', 'The amount a patient must pay out-of-pocket for covered healthcare services before their insurance begins to pay.', 'Deductibles reset annually (typically January 1) and vary widely, from $500 to $8,000+ for high-deductible health plans. The deductible applies to most services except those exempt by law (like preventive care under ACA) or by plan design (like copay-based services). Once the deductible is met, the insurance begins cost-sharing through coinsurance. Family plans often have both individual and family deductibles - when any family member meets the individual deductible, insurance begins covering that person, or when the family deductible is met, everyone is covered. Deductible amounts are tracked by the insurance company throughout the year.', 'A patient has a $3,000 annual deductible and has paid $2,500 toward it this year. They have surgery with an allowed amount of $2,000. The patient owes $500 to meet their remaining deductible, then insurance begins paying per the coinsurance split for the remaining $1,500 (e.g., insurance pays $1,200 and patient pays $300 if they have 80/20 coinsurance).', 'High-deductible plans have increased patient financial responsibility significantly. Providers must verify deductible amounts and communicate financial responsibility upfront to avoid surprise bills and collection issues. Offering payment plans for high-deductible patients improves collections. Understanding deductible status is essential for accurate patient estimates and financial counseling.', 'Financial Terms', ARRAY['Coinsurance', 'Out-of-Pocket Maximum', 'High-Deductible Health Plan', 'Patient Responsibility']),

('Explanation of Benefits (EOB)', 'A statement from an insurance company explaining what medical services were paid and why.', 'An EOB is sent to patients (and sometimes providers) after a claim is processed. It is not a bill but an explanation of claim adjudication. The EOB shows: services provided, dates of service, billed amounts, allowed amounts, insurance payments, patient responsibility (deductible, coinsurance, copay), and claim denial reasons if applicable. EOBs help patients understand their insurance benefits and verify that services were processed correctly. Provider EOBs (remittance advice) include payment information for reconciliation. Understanding how to read EOBs is essential for both patients and billing staff to identify errors or denials.', 'After a patient''s doctor visit, they receive an EOB showing: Service: Office Visit, Date: 01/15/2024, Amount Billed: $250, Allowed Amount: $150, Insurance Paid: $120, Patient Responsibility: $30 copay (already paid at visit). The patient owes nothing additional because the copay was collected at time of service.', 'EOBs are essential for transparency and help patients understand why they owe money. For providers, EOB review identifies underpayments, incorrect adjustments, and processing errors. Discrepancies between expected and actual payments require follow-up. Training patients to review EOBs and contact their insurance with questions can reduce provider administrative burden.', 'Insurance Terms', ARRAY['Remittance Advice', 'ERA', 'Claim Adjudication', 'Patient Statement']);

-- MEDICAL CODING TERMS
INSERT INTO glossary_terms (term, definition, detailed_explanation, example, why_it_matters, category, related_terms) VALUES
('CPT Code', 'Current Procedural Terminology codes used to describe medical, surgical, and diagnostic services.', 'CPT codes are maintained by the American Medical Association (AMA) and are required for insurance billing. The three categories are: Category I (most common procedures and services, 5-digit numeric codes), Category II (performance measurement and quality reporting, optional), and Category III (emerging technologies and procedures). CPT codes are updated annually with additions, deletions, and revisions. Each code represents a specific service, procedure, or evaluation. Proper CPT coding ensures accurate billing, compliance, and appropriate reimbursement. Modifiers are appended to CPT codes to provide additional information about services rendered.', 'A primary care provider performs an established patient office visit with moderate complexity decision-making. The correct CPT code is 99214. If the provider also performs a separate procedure on the same day, modifier 25 would be appended to the E/M code (99214-25) to indicate a separately identifiable evaluation and management service.', 'Incorrect CPT coding can result in claim denials, underpayment, or compliance issues. Upcoding (using a higher-level code than justified) or unbundling (billing separately for services that should be billed together) can trigger audits and penalties. Accurate CPT coding requires thorough documentation and regular coder training on annual code updates.', 'Medical Coding', ARRAY['ICD-10 Code', 'HCPCS Code', 'Modifier', 'Evaluation and Management']),

('ICD-10 Code', 'International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision - diagnosis codes used to describe patient conditions and diseases.', 'ICD-10 codes are maintained by the World Health Organization (WHO) and mandated for use in the U.S. since October 2015. These alphanumeric codes provide specific diagnostic information supporting medical necessity for services. ICD-10-CM (Clinical Modification) is used in the U.S. for outpatient and physician services. ICD-10 has over 70,000 codes compared to 14,000 in ICD-9, providing much greater specificity. Codes have 3-7 characters, with the first character being alpha, followed by numeric, and sometimes additional alpha characters. The 7th character often indicates encounter type (initial, subsequent, sequela) or laterality. Placeholder "X" is used when a 7th character is required but there is no 6th character.', 'A patient presents with Type 2 diabetes with diabetic neuropathy. The ICD-10 code is E11.40 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus with diabetic neuropathy, unspecified). If the patient also has hypertension, the secondary diagnosis code I10 (Essential hypertension) would be included. The primary diagnosis code should reflect the main reason for the encounter.', 'Accurate ICD-10 coding is essential for establishing medical necessity, supporting reimbursement, and avoiding claim denials. Specificity is critical - vague codes or "unspecified" codes may result in denials or lower reimbursement. ICD-10 codes must match and support the CPT codes billed. Regular updates occur annually on October 1st, requiring ongoing coder education.', 'Medical Coding', ARRAY['CPT Code', 'Medical Necessity', 'Diagnosis Code', 'Primary Diagnosis']),

('Modifier', 'Two-digit codes appended to CPT or HCPCS codes to provide additional information about a service.', 'Modifiers indicate that a service was altered in some way without changing the basic definition of the code. Common uses include: indicating multiple procedures, bilateral procedures, discontinued procedures, distinct procedural services, professional versus technical components, and services by different providers. Some critical modifiers: 25 (significant separately identifiable E/M service on same day as procedure), 59 (distinct procedural service), 76 (repeat procedure by same physician), 77 (repeat procedure by another physician), 50 (bilateral procedure), LT/RT (left/right), 51 (multiple procedures). Incorrect modifier usage is a common cause of claim denials. Some modifiers increase payment, while others reduce it.', 'A patient has surgery on both knees during the same session. The surgeon bills the knee arthroscopy code (29881) with modifier 50 to indicate a bilateral procedure. Some payers will pay 150% of the single procedure fee for bilateral procedures (100% for first side, 50% for second side).', 'Proper modifier usage is essential for accurate reimbursement and compliance. Missing modifiers can result in bundling denials, where procedures are incorrectly combined. Inappropriate modifier use can be considered fraud if done knowingly to increase payment. Modifier 25 is one of the most scrutinized modifiers in audits, requiring clear documentation of a separately identifiable service.', 'Medical Coding', ARRAY['CPT Code', 'Bilateral Procedure', 'Distinct Procedural Service', 'Bundling']),

('HCPCS Code', 'Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System - codes used to bill for products, supplies, and services not included in CPT.', 'HCPCS (pronounced "hick-picks") has two levels: Level I (CPT codes) and Level II (national codes for supplies, durable medical equipment, ambulance services, and other items). Level II HCPCS codes begin with letters A-V and are 5 characters. Common uses include: durable medical equipment (E codes), orthotics and prosthetics (L codes), temporary codes (Q codes), medications (J codes), and ambulance services (A codes). HCPCS codes are maintained by CMS and updated quarterly. Many HCPCS codes require special modifiers and documentation. Certain codes require prior authorization or are subject to local coverage determinations (LCDs).', 'A patient is prescribed a knee brace after surgery. The medical equipment supplier bills HCPCS code L1832 (knee orthosis, adjustable knee joints, rigid thigh and calf). If provided to the right knee, modifier RT is appended: L1832-RT. The claim must include documentation of medical necessity and the prescribing physician''s information.', 'Proper HCPCS coding is crucial for DME suppliers, ambulance services, and practices administering medications or providing supplies. Many HCPCS codes have strict coverage rules and documentation requirements. Incorrect coding or lack of supporting documentation leads to denials. J-codes for medications must be reported with exact units and dosages.', 'Medical Coding', ARRAY['CPT Code', 'DME', 'J-Code', 'Durable Medical Equipment']),

('Evaluation and Management (E/M)', 'CPT codes used for office visits, consultations, and other patient evaluation services.', 'E/M codes (99202-99499) are the most commonly billed services in healthcare. They cover: office visits (new and established patients), hospital visits, emergency department visits, consultations, and other encounter types. E/M levels are determined by: complexity of medical decision-making, history taking, examination, time spent (for time-based billing), and presenting problem severity. As of 2021, outpatient E/M codes (99202-99215) are selected based primarily on medical decision-making or total encounter time. Proper documentation is essential to support the E/M level billed. Correct level selection requires understanding the guidelines updated regularly by CMS and AMA.', 'An established patient with multiple chronic conditions (diabetes, hypertension, heart disease) comes for a follow-up visit. The physician reviews medications, orders new labs, adjusts two medications, and discusses diabetes management for 35 minutes total time. This encounter supports CPT code 99215 (established patient office visit, high complexity medical decision-making, or 40-54 minutes total time).', 'E/M coding is frequently audited due to high volume and vulnerability to upcoding. Accurate E/M coding requires thorough documentation to support the level billed. Downcoding (using a lower level than documentation supports) costs practices significant revenue. Upcoding risks audits, recoupment, and potential fraud allegations. Regular provider education on documentation requirements is essential.', 'Medical Coding', ARRAY['CPT Code', 'Medical Decision Making', 'Time-Based Billing', 'Documentation']);

-- REVENUE CYCLE MANAGEMENT TERMS  
INSERT INTO glossary_terms (term, definition, detailed_explanation, example, why_it_matters, category, related_terms) VALUES
('Revenue Cycle Management (RCM)', 'The financial process healthcare providers use to track patient care from registration through final payment.', 'RCM encompasses all administrative and clinical functions that contribute to capture, management, and collection of patient service revenue. The cycle includes: pre-registration, insurance verification, charge capture, coding, claim submission, payment posting, denial management, and patient collections. Effective RCM ensures maximum reimbursement in the shortest time frame. Key performance indicators include: days in A/R, clean claim rate, denial rate, collection rate, and net collection percentage. Modern RCM leverages technology for automation, analytics, and workflow optimization. End-to-end RCM solutions integrate clinical and financial systems.', 'A well-managed RCM process at a multi-specialty practice: (1) Pre-registers patients and verifies insurance 48 hours before appointments, (2) Collects copays at check-in, (3) Captures charges in real-time during encounters, (4) Submits claims within 24 hours, (5) Achieves 96% clean claim rate, (6) Posts payments within 2 days, (7) Works denials within 5 days, (8) Maintains 35 days in A/R.', 'Optimized RCM directly impacts practice profitability and cash flow. Poor RCM can cost practices 5-10% of revenue through denials, missed charges, and slow collections. RCM technology and process improvements typically show ROI within 6-12 months. Many practices outsource RCM to focus on patient care while improving financial performance.', 'Revenue Cycle', ARRAY['Account Receivable', 'Clean Claim Rate', 'Denial Rate', 'Collection Rate']),

('Denial Management', 'The process of investigating, correcting, and resubmitting denied insurance claims.', 'Denial management is a critical RCM function that recovers revenue from denied claims. The process includes: identifying denials from remittance advice, categorizing denial reasons, determining correctability, correcting and resubmitting claims, appealing inappropriate denials, and tracking denial trends to prevent future occurrences. Common denial categories: missing information, authorization issues, coding errors, timely filing, eligibility issues, and medical necessity. Best practices include working denials within 5-7 days, prioritizing high-dollar denials, and implementing root cause analysis to prevent recurring denials. Denial rates should be below 5-10% of claims submitted.', 'A practice receives a denial from Blue Cross for lack of prior authorization on an MRI claim worth $1,200. The denial management team reviews the case, discovers the authorization was obtained but the number wasn''t on the claim. They correct and resubmit the claim with the authorization number, and it is paid within 14 days, recovering the $1,200 that would have been lost without denial management.', 'Industry studies show that 60-65% of denied claims are never reworked, resulting in significant lost revenue. Every 1% increase in denials can cost a practice hundreds of thousands in annual revenue. Effective denial management can recover 60-90% of denied claims. Trend analysis identifies systemic issues that, when corrected, can reduce overall denial rates by 2-5%, directly improving bottom-line profitability.', 'Claims & Denials', ARRAY['Claim Denial', 'Appeal Process', 'Timely Filing', 'Root Cause Analysis']),

('Eligibility Verification', 'The process of confirming a patient''s insurance coverage and benefits before providing services.', 'Eligibility verification confirms active insurance coverage, identifies the correct insurance plan, determines coverage for specific services, identifies deductible and out-of-pocket status, verifies primary versus secondary insurance, and identifies any authorization requirements. Verification should occur 24-48 hours before scheduled appointments and again at check-in. Real-time eligibility systems query payer databases instantly. Verification prevents claim denials due to inactive coverage, incorrect insurance information, or lack of authorization. It enables accurate patient estimates and upfront payment collection. Verification results should be documented in the practice management system.', 'Before a scheduled surgery, the scheduler verifies the patient''s insurance 5 days in advance. The verification reveals the patient has met their $2,000 deductible, has 80/20 coinsurance for the procedure, requires prior authorization, and the procedure is covered. The scheduler obtains the authorization, estimates the patient will owe approximately $1,800 (20% of the allowed amount), and arranges a payment plan, all before the surgery date.', 'Eligibility verification reduces denials by 30-40% and enables upfront payment collection. Services provided to patients with inactive insurance or without required authorizations often result in complete non-payment. Real-time eligibility checking at registration prevents scheduling patients who are not eligible, reducing no-shows and administrative burden. Accurate benefit information enables better patient communication and reduces billing disputes.', 'Billing Process', ARRAY['Insurance Verification', 'Benefits Verification', 'Authorization', 'Patient Estimate']),

('Remittance Advice', 'A document from an insurance payer explaining how claims were processed and paid.', 'Remittance advice can be paper (Explanation of Benefits/EOB) or electronic (ERA - Electronic Remittance Advice). It includes: claim identification, service dates, procedure codes, billed amounts, allowed amounts, payments made, adjustments taken, patient responsibility, and denial/adjustment codes explaining any claim actions. ERA files follow the 835 EDI transaction format and can be automatically posted to practice management systems. Remittance advice is essential for payment posting, identifying underpayments, recognizing denials requiring follow-up, and reconciling payments. Reviewing remittance advice line-by-line can identify payer errors and underpayments worth pursuing.', 'A practice receives an ERA from Aetna containing 100 claim payments. The ERA shows: Claim A paid in full as expected, Claim B denied for missing authorization (denial code CO-50), Claim C paid at a lower amount than expected due to bundling, and Claim D has a patient responsibility balance of $250. The billing staff uses this information to: appeal Claim B, investigate the bundling on Claim C, and bill the patient for Claim D.', 'Proper remittance advice review is essential for identifying revenue recovery opportunities. Payer errors occur in 1-3% of claims, and most require provider follow-up to correct. Automated ERA posting improves efficiency but still requires exception review. Understanding remittance advice codes (CARC, RARC) is critical for billing staff to take appropriate action on denied or adjusted claims.', 'Claims & Denials', ARRAY['ERA', 'EOB', 'Payment Posting', 'Denial Codes']),

('Aging Report', 'A report showing outstanding accounts receivable balances categorized by how long they have been unpaid.', 'The A/R aging report typically categorizes balances into buckets: current (0-30 days), 31-60 days, 61-90 days, 91-120 days, and over 120 days. The report is generated separately for insurance A/R and patient A/R. As claims age, they become harder to collect, with collection rates dropping dramatically after 90 days. The aging report guides collection priorities - older, high-dollar balances should be worked first. Healthy practices should have 60-70% of A/R in the current bucket and less than 15-20% over 90 days. Regular aging report review identifies stuck claims, reveals payer-specific payment delays, and helps prioritize denial rework and appeals.', 'A practice''s aging report shows $500,000 total A/R: $350,000 (70%) in 0-30 days, $80,000 (16%) in 31-60 days, $40,000 (8%) in 61-90 days, and $30,000 (6%) over 90 days. The billing manager prioritizes working the over-90-day bucket first, focusing on claims over $1,000, and discovers that $15,000 of these are denials that can be corrected and resubmitted.', 'The aging report is a primary financial health indicator for practices. A healthy aging distribution predicts consistent cash flow. Deteriorating aging (increasing percentages in older buckets) signals problems in the revenue cycle requiring immediate attention. Improving aging by reducing over-90-day balances from 20% to 10% can recover significant revenue and improve cash flow predictability.', 'Revenue Cycle', ARRAY['Account Receivable', 'Days in A/R', 'Collection Rate', 'Revenue Cycle Management']);

('HIPAA', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act - federal law protecting patient health information privacy and security.', 'HIPAA (enacted 1996) establishes national standards for protecting patient Protected Health Information (PHI). Key components include: Privacy Rule (controls use and disclosure of PHI), Security Rule (protects electronic PHI with administrative, physical, and technical safeguards), Breach Notification Rule (requires notification of data breaches), and Enforcement Rule (outlines penalties for violations). HIPAA applies to covered entities (healthcare providers, health plans, clearinghouses) and business associates (vendors handling PHI). Violations range from $100 to $50,000 per violation, with annual maximums up to $1.5 million per violation category. Compliance requires: written policies and procedures, staff training, risk assessments, business associate agreements, and breach response plans.', 'A medical practice implements HIPAA compliance: (1) All staff complete annual HIPAA training, (2) Computer systems require unique user IDs and complex passwords, (3) Paper records are locked, (4) Business associate agreements are signed with billing company and IT vendor, (5) Encryption is used for all electronic PHI, (6) A privacy officer is designated, (7) Patients sign HIPAA authorization forms before information is shared.', 'HIPAA violations can result in massive fines, criminal charges, loss of medical license, reputation damage, and civil lawsuits.

Compliance programs include: written policies, regular auditing and monitoring, staff training, response and corrective action plans, and designated compliance officers. OIG (Office of Inspector General) provides compliance guidance for various healthcare sectors. Non-compliance risks include: audits, repayment demands, civil monetary penalties, exclusion from federal programs, and criminal prosecution.', 'A practice establishes a compliance program: (1) Appoints a compliance officer, (2) Creates written policies on proper coding, documentation, and billing, (3) Conducts quarterly internal audits of 10 charts per provider, (4) Provides annual compliance training to all staff, (5) Establishes anonymous reporting mechanisms for potential violations, (6) Responds to compliance issues with corrective action plans and overpayment returns when appropriate.', 'Healthcare compliance prevents fraud allegations, audit findings, and penalties that can devastate practices. The False Claims Act allows whistleblowers to file qui tam lawsuits, and providers can be liable for triple damages plus penalties.

('Medical Necessity', 'The requirement that healthcare services must be appropriate, reasonable, and necessary for diagnosis or treatment.', 'Medical necessity is determined by: clinical standards of care, FDA-approved uses, published medical literature, and payer medical policies. Services that are not medically necessary are not covered by insurance, even if they are provided. Documentation must support medical necessity - the diagnosis codes must support the procedure codes billed. Payers define medical necessity through: national coverage determinations (NCDs), local coverage determinations (LCDs), and medical policies. Services performed without establishing medical necessity may be denied, and providers may not be able to bill patients for these services. Medical necessity is the most common reason for claim denials requiring appeals.', 'A patient requests an MRI for chronic back pain. The physician''s documentation shows: 8 weeks of conservative treatment (physical therapy, medications), persistent symptoms, neurological deficits on exam, and need to rule out disc herniation before considering surgery. This documentation establishes medical necessity. Without documenting failed conservative treatment and specific clinical findings, the MRI might be denied as not medically necessary.', 'Lack of medical necessity is a primary reason for claim denials and audit findings. Providers must understand payer medical policies before ordering services. Documentation must paint a clear picture of why services are necessary.

DHS includes: lab services, imaging, physical therapy, DME, inpatient/outpatient hospital services, and more. Financial relationships include ownership, investment interests, and compensation arrangements. Violations are strict liability (intent not required) and can result in: denial of payment, refund of amounts collected, civil monetary penalties up to $25,000 per violation, and exclusion from federal programs. Unlike fraud statutes, Stark violations don''t require intent. Numerous exceptions exist (in-office ancillary services, fair market value compensation, etc.) but must be strictly followed.', 'A physician owns 20% of an imaging center. Under Stark Law, they cannot refer their Medicare patients to that imaging center unless a specific exception applies. If the imaging center performs only in-office services ancillary to the physician''s practice and meets all requirements of the in-office ancillary services exception, referrals may be permitted. The arrangement must be carefully structured and documented.', 'Stark Law violations, even unintentional, can result in massive financial penalties and exclusion from Medicare. Many practices unknowingly violate Stark through poorly structured arrangements with providers or entities.

Unlike Stark, AKS requires intent, applies to all items/services (not just DHS), covers both federal and private payers in some states, and is a criminal statute (not just civil). Violations can result in: criminal penalties (up to 5 years in prison, $25,000 fines per violation), civil monetary penalties ($50,000+ per violation plus treble damages), and exclusion from federal programs. Safe harbors provide protection if all requirements are met. Common risk areas: free or below-market leases, forgiveness of patient cost-sharing, excessive compensation for services, and gifts to referral sources.', 'A physician group enters a management services agreement with a hospital. To comply with AKS safe harbors, the agreement must: be in writing and signed, specify all services to be provided, set compensation at fair market value, cover at least one year, and not be based on volume or value of referrals.

('Claim Denial', 'An insurance payer''s refusal to pay for a submitted claim, either partially or in full.', 'Denials occur when claims do not meet payer requirements for payment. Denials are different from rejections - rejections occur before claim adjudication due to technical errors, while denials occur after adjudication. Common denial reasons: missing or invalid information (patient demographics, insurance info), lack of medical necessity, services not covered, authorization not obtained, timely filing limits exceeded, duplicate claims, coding errors, and eligibility issues. Denial codes (CARC and RARC) explain the reason. Some denials are "soft" (correctable and resubmittable) while others are "hard" (require appeal). Industry averages show 5-10% denial rates, but this varies by specialty and payer. Prevention is more cost-effective than denial rework.', 'A surgery claim is denied with code CO-16: "Claim/service lacks information which is needed for adjudication." Review reveals the diagnosis code was missing. This is a soft denial - the claim can be corrected with the diagnosis code and resubmitted for payment. The same claim denied with code CO-50 for "not covered" would require an appeal with medical records to demonstrate coverage.', 'Every denied claim represents delayed or lost revenue and increases administrative costs. The average cost to work a denial is $25-$50, making denial prevention crucial. High denial rates indicate systemic revenue cycle problems. First-pass resolution rate (percentage of claims paid on first submission) is a key performance indicator. Reducing denials by just 2-3% can add hundreds of thousands to practice revenue annually.', 'Claims & Denials', ARRAY['Denial Management', 'Claim Rejection', 'Appeal Process', 'Denial Codes']),

('Claim Rejection', 'A claim returned by a payer before processing due to technical errors or missing required information.', 'Rejections differ from denials - rejections occur at the clearinghouse or payer front-end before adjudication, typically within hours or days. Common rejection reasons: invalid patient or subscriber ID, invalid payer ID, invalid provider NPI, duplicate claim, invalid CPT or diagnosis codes, missing required information, and formatting errors. Rejections must be corrected and resubmitted; they do not count against timely filing limits. Modern claim scrubbing software catches most rejections before submission. Clearinghouses provide rejection reports identifying specific errors. High rejection rates indicate data quality issues or system problems requiring correction.', 'A practice submits 100 claims to Medicare. Five are rejected by the clearinghouse with the error: "Invalid Medicare ID number - check digit does not match." The billing staff corrects the Medicare ID numbers, resubmits the claims the same day, and they pass clearinghouse edits and are sent to Medicare for processing. No time is lost since rejections don''t count toward timely filing.', 'While rejections are less serious than denials (they can be quickly corrected and resubmitted), high rejection rates indicate poor data quality and increase workload. Best practices target rejection rates below 2-3%. Real-time eligibility verification at registration prevents many rejection reasons. Claim scrubbing before submission catches most errors. Staff training on proper data entry (especially insurance information) reduces rejections.', 'Claims & Denials', ARRAY['Claim Denial', 'Clean Claim', 'Claim Scrubbing', 'Clearinghouse']),

('Appeal Process', 'The formal procedure for challenging an insurance company''s claim denial or payment decision.', 'When a claim is denied, providers have the right to appeal through a structured process. Most payers have multiple appeal levels: first-level (reconsideration), second-level (independent review), and final (external review or payer board). Appeals must be filed within specific timeframes (typically 30-180 days depending on payer and claim type). Successful appeals require: clear written explanation of why the denial is incorrect, supporting documentation (medical records, payer policies, medical literature), and specific reference to coverage policies. Appeals should be tracked with deadlines monitored. For Medicare, appeals progress through: redetermination, reconsideration, ALJ hearing, Medicare Appeals Council, and federal court. Success rates vary, but 40-60% of appealed denials are overturned.', 'A surgery claim is denied for lack of medical necessity. The surgeon files a first-level appeal within 30 days, including: detailed operative report, office notes showing failed conservative treatment, peer-reviewed studies supporting the procedure, and citation of the payer''s medical policy with explanation of how the case meets criteria. The appeal is successful, and the $15,000 claim is paid 45 days after the appeal.', 'Appeals can recover significant denied revenue - often tens of thousands per month for busy practices. However, appeals are time-consuming, so prioritization is essential (focus on high-dollar, clinically appropriate denials). Tracking appeal success rates by denial reason and payer identifies which denials are worth appealing. Pattern recognition from appeals can identify root causes to prevent future denials. External review rights exist if internal appeals are exhausted.', 'Claims & Denials', ARRAY['Denial Management', 'Medical Necessity', 'Peer Review', 'Overturn Rate']),

('Timely Filing', 'The deadline within which insurance claims must be submitted to payers for payment consideration.', 'Timely filing limits vary by payer and contract, typically ranging from 90 days to one year from the date of service. Commercial payers often have 90-180 day limits, while Medicare has a one-year timely filing limit. Claims submitted after the deadline are denied as untimely and cannot be collected from the patient (due to contract requirements). Timely filing denials are considered "hard denials" with very limited appeal rights. Exceptions may exist for: corrected claims (resubmissions after denials), retroactive eligibility determinations, or payer processing delays. Best practices include submitting clean claims within 24-48 hours of service and tracking all denials to ensure resubmissions stay within timely filing.', 'A practice submits a claim 95 days after the date of service. The payer contract specifies a 90-day timely filing limit. The claim is denied as untimely filing, and the practice cannot collect the $800 from the patient due to contractual obligations. If the claim had been initially submitted within 90 days but denied for a correctable reason, the corrected resubmission would typically be allowed even after the initial filing deadline.', 'Timely filing denials represent completely unrecoverable revenue losses. Missing timely filing due to process delays, claim backlogs, or overlooked denials directly impacts bottom-line profitability. Practices should submit all claims within days of service, not weeks or months. Automated claim submission processes prevent filing delays. Tracking initial denial dates and calculating remaining filing time prevents secondary losses when reworking denied claims.', 'Claims & Denials', ARRAY['Clean Claim', 'Denial Management', 'Claim Submission', 'Hard Denial']),

('Claim Scrubbing', 'The automated process of reviewing claims for errors before submission to payers.', 'Claim scrubbing software checks claims against payer rules, coding guidelines, and common rejection reasons before submission. Scrubbing identifies: invalid or outdated codes, missing required information, incorrect modifier usage, coding logic errors, gender/age conflicts, medical necessity issues, and authorization requirement alerts. Scrubbing occurs at multiple levels: practice management system edits, clearinghouse scrubbing, and specialized third-party scrubbing services. Effective scrubbing can reduce rejections and denials by 30-50%. Scrubbing rules must be continuously updated as payer requirements and code sets change. While automated, scrubbing results require human review to override false positives and address complex situations.', 'A practice submits claims through a clearinghouse with advanced scrubbing. A claim for a knee MRI is flagged because: (1) the procedure code requires a "LT" or "RT" modifier for laterality, (2) the diagnosis code suggests an upper extremity problem rather than knee, and (3) the scrubber identifies that this payer requires prior authorization for MRI. The billing staff corrects the missing modifier, reviews the diagnosis code with the provider, and verifies the authorization before resubmitting.', 'Claim scrubbing is a cost-effective way to improve clean claim rates and reduce denials. Every claim error caught before submission prevents a rejection or denial that would cost $25-$50 in rework time. Scrubbing also provides staff education - seeing common errors helps billers learn correct practices. However, scrubbing is not a substitute for accurate initial data entry and coding. Over-reliance on scrubbing can mask underlying quality issues that should be addressed through training.', 'Claims & Denials', ARRAY['Clean Claim', 'Claim Rejection', 'Clearinghouse', 'Edit Checks']);

Write-offs must be properly categorized for financial reporting and analysis. Excessive write-offs in certain categories indicate problems requiring attention - high bad debt suggests collection process issues, high timely filing losses indicate workflow problems, etc. IRS regulations govern when bad debt can be written off for tax purposes.', 'A practice analyzes its monthly write-offs: Contractual adjustments $50,000 (expected per payer contracts), Small balance write-offs $1,200 (balances under $10), Bad debt $3,500 (after 90 days collection efforts), Timely filing denials $2,800 (workflow issue being addressed), Administrative adjustments $800 (billing errors). Total write-offs: $58,300. The $2,800 timely filing write-off represents process failures that should be eliminated.', 'Write-off analysis reveals revenue cycle health and identifies improvement opportunities. Contractual write-offs should match expected amounts based on payer mix and contracts - variations may indicate fee schedule problems or contract issues. Bad debt write-offs above 2-3% suggest collection process improvements are needed. Timely filing write-offs should be zero - any amount represents preventable losses. Tracking write-offs by category and reason enables targeted interventions.', 'Financial Terms', ARRAY['Adjustment', 'Bad Debt', 'Contractual Allowance', 'Collection Rate']),

('Days in A/R', 'The average number of days it takes to collect payment after services are provided, a key metric for revenue cycle performance.', 'Days in A/R is calculated as: (Total A/R balance ÷ Average daily charges). For example, $500,000 A/R ÷ $15,000 average daily charges = 33.3 days in A/R. Industry benchmarks vary by specialty but generally range from 30-50 days, with best practices targeting under 40 days. Lower days in A/R indicates faster payment and better cash flow. High days in A/R suggests: slow claim submission, high denial rates, slow payment from payers, collection problems, or large accumulation of old A/R. Days in A/R should be monitored monthly with trend analysis. Improvements in clean claim rate, denial management, and collection processes directly reduce days in A/R.', 'Practice A has days in A/R of 35, meaning on average they collect payment 35 days after service. Practice B has 60 days in A/R. If both practices have $10,000 in daily charges, Practice A has $350,000 in A/R while Practice B has $600,000 - that''s $250,000 more tied up in unpaid claims for Practice B, creating significant cash flow challenges.', 'Days in A/R directly correlates with cash flow and practice financial health. Every day of improvement in A/R days frees up significant working capital. Practices with increasing days in A/R often face cash flow crises. Conversely, reducing days in A/R by even 5-10 days can eliminate the need for practice loans or lines of credit. Days in A/R is one of the most important metrics tracked by practice managers and lenders.', 'Revenue Cycle', ARRAY['Account Receivable', 'Aging Report', 'Clean Claim Rate', 'Cash Flow']),

('Collection Rate', 'The percentage of expected revenue that is actually collected, measuring effectiveness of collection efforts.', 'Collection rate calculations vary, but the most meaningful is: (Total collections ÷ Total charges after contractual adjustments) × 100. This is called "net collection rate" and measures how much of collectible money is actually collected. A perfect score is 100%, meaning all expected payments are collected. Rates below 95% indicate collection problems. Gross collection rate (collections ÷ charges before adjustments) is less useful because it''s impacted by high charges vs. allowed amounts. Collection rates should be calculated separately for insurance and patient balances, as patient collection rates are typically lower (70-90%) than insurance rates (95-98%). Factors affecting collection rate: clean claim rate, denial management effectiveness, patient collection processes, and A/R follow-up.', 'A practice has $1,000,000 in charges, $300,000 in contractual adjustments (leaving $700,000 expected collections), and actually collects $665,000. Net collection rate = ($665,000 ÷ $700,000) = 95%. The missing 5% ($35,000) represents uncollected revenue that warrants investigation - likely a combination of denials, bad debt, and timely filing losses.', 'Collection rate directly measures how much expected money actually reaches the practice''s bank account. Every 1% improvement in collection rate adds significant revenue with no additional patients or services. Low collection rates often stem from: inadequate denial follow-up, poor patient collection, slow claim submission, or ineffective A/R follow-up. Benchmarking collection rates against industry standards identifies underperformance requiring process improvements.', 'Financial Terms', ARRAY['Clean Claim Rate', 'Denial Rate', 'Bad Debt', 'Revenue Cycle Management']),

('Patient Statement', 'A bill sent to patients showing their financial responsibility for healthcare services after insurance processing.', 'Patient statements itemize: service dates, procedure descriptions, charges, insurance payments, adjustments, and current patient balance due. Statements should clearly show how the balance was calculated, including deductible, coinsurance, copay amounts, and non-covered services. Best practices include: sending statements within days of insurance payment posting, using clear language avoiding jargon, offering payment options and plans, including payment instructions and deadlines, and providing contact information for billing questions. Statement frequency varies (weekly, bi-weekly, monthly) with increasing urgency for older balances. Electronic statements reduce costs and can improve payment rates. Statements should comply with FCRA (Fair Credit Reporting Act) and FDCPA (Fair Debt Collection Practices Act) regulations.', 'A patient receives a statement showing: Office visit date 10/15, Total charges $250, Insurance paid $180 (after $50 contractual adjustment and patient already paid $20 copay at visit), Patient balance due $50 (20% coinsurance). The statement clearly explains: "This balance is your responsibility per your insurance benefits" and offers online payment and payment plan options.', 'Clear, timely patient statements are essential for patient collections. Confusing statements generate billing inquiries and payment delays. The longer between service and statement, the lower the collection rate - this drops from 70%+ in the first 30 days to under 50% after 90 days. Professional, friendly statements reduce patient frustration while maintaining collection effectiveness. Many patients are willing to pay if they understand what they owe and have convenient payment options.', 'Financial Terms', ARRAY['Patient Responsibility', 'EOB', 'Patient Collections', 'Payment Plan']),

('Refund', 'Money returned to a patient or payer due to overpayment, duplicate payment, or other payment corrections.', 'Refunds occur for several reasons: duplicate payments (payer pays twice for same service), overpayments (payer pays more than allowed amount or patient obligation), patient overpayments (patient pays more than their responsibility), credit balances (when account has negative balance), and claim recoupment (payer takes back a payment after audit). Federal and state regulations govern refund timeframes - typically 30-60 days. Failure to return overpayments can result in False Claims Act liability. Refund requests from payers must be carefully reviewed - not all are valid. Patient refunds require written notice explaining the refund reason. Practices should maintain credit balance reports and proactively process refunds to avoid compliance issues.', 'A patient pays their $50 copay at check-in. Later, the claim is processed and shows the patient actually had no copay for this preventive service. The practice must refund the $50 to the patient within 30-60 days per state law. Separately, an insurance company pays $800 for a claim, then later audits the claim and requests return of $200 due to an overpayment. The practice reviews the request, verifies the overpayment is correct, and returns $200 to the payer.', 'Proper refund processing protects practices from compliance violations and fraud allegations. The False Claims Act can apply to retained overpayments, even if unintentional. Regular credit balance reports identify refund obligations. Many practices struggle with refund processing, leading to accumulation of credit balances and compliance risk. Accurate payment posting prevents many overpayments.

Unlike paper records, EHRs can be shared across healthcare settings, improving care coordination and patient safety. Certified EHRs meet standards for meaningful use/promoting interoperability, qualifying providers for CMS incentives and avoiding penalties. EHRs integrate with practice management systems for billing, scheduling, and RCM. Features include: computerized provider order entry (CPOE), clinical decision support, e-prescribing, patient portals, quality reporting, and population health management. EHR adoption is mandated for many providers participating in federal programs.', 'A primary care practice uses an EHR system that allows the physician to review patient history, view lab results from external facilities, prescribe medications electronically, document encounters with structured templates, and automatically capture charges for billing. The patient can access their records, test results, and communicate with providers through a patient portal integrated with the EHR.', 'EHRs improve clinical care quality, patient safety, and care coordination while enabling revenue cycle benefits through better documentation, charge capture, and coding accuracy.

('Clearinghouse', 'An entity that receives and processes electronic healthcare transactions, translating them into formats required by payers.', 'Clearinghouses serve as intermediaries between providers and payers, performing several functions: format translation (converting claims to payer-specific formats), validation (checking claims for errors before submission), routing (sending claims to appropriate payers), status tracking (monitoring claim status), and remittance processing (handling ERA files). Clearinghouses are required to be HIPAA compliant and are considered business associates. They typically charge per transaction (per claim submitted). Major clearinghouses include Change Healthcare, Availity, and others. Clearinghouses provide value by: reducing claim errors, enabling electronic submission to hundreds of payers, providing real-time claim status, and simplifying the submission process.', 'A medical practice submits all claims through a clearinghouse. When the billing staff submits 50 claims, the clearinghouse: (1) Validates each claim for formatting errors, (2) Checks for common rejection reasons, (3) Converts claims to each payer''s specific format requirements, (4) Transmits claims electronically to multiple different payers, (5) Provides confirmation of receipt, (6) Monitors claim status and provides updates. The clearinghouse charges the practice $0.50 per claim.', 'Clearinghouses dramatically reduce claim rejections and simplify multi-payer submission. Direct submission to payers requires understanding each payer''s unique format requirements - clearinghouses eliminate this complexity. Real-time eligibility checking and claim status features reduce administrative burden.

Documentation must clearly show the separate nature of the E/M service - distinct presenting problems, separate history and exam elements, or significant separately identifiable decision-making. Modifier 25 is one of the most frequently used and audited modifiers. Common audit triggers: overuse (using on every procedure day), lack of documentation supporting separate service, or using for minimal services. To support modifier 25, documentation should use separate paragraphs or sections for the E/M and procedure.', 'A patient presents for a scheduled minor skin lesion removal (CPT 11200). During the visit, the patient also reports new onset of chest pain and shortness of breath. The physician performs a complete cardiovascular evaluation, orders an EKG, and determines the patient needs referral to cardiology.

There are two types: Type 1 (individual providers like physicians, nurses, therapists) and Type 2 (organizational providers like hospitals, clinics, group practices). NPIs are permanent and do not change if a provider changes specialties, locations, or states. Providers must apply for NPIs through NPPES (National Plan and Provider Enumeration System). Using incorrect or missing NPIs is a common cause of claim rejections. Practices must ensure all rendering, referring, and billing provider NPIs are accurate and up to date on claims.', 'Dr. Smith''s individual NPI (Type 1) is 1234567890. When Dr. Smith joins ABC Medical Group, the practice''s organizational NPI (Type 2) is 9876543210.

If the claim is missing or has an incorrect rendering NPI, it will be rejected by the payer.', 'Accurate NPI usage is essential for clean claims and provider credentialing. NPI errors are a top rejection reason. Providers must update their NPI information in NPPES when practice information changes.

('Bundling', 'When separate procedure codes are combined into a single, comprehensive code for billing purposes.', 'Bundling occurs when multiple procedure codes are billed together but payer edits combine them into one code based on coding guidelines or payer policies. The most common bundling edits come from: NCCI (National Correct Coding Initiative) edits, CCI (Correct Coding Initiative) edits, and payer-specific bundling rules. Bundling is appropriate when procedures are integral to each other, represent different components of a comprehensive service, or are performed through the same surgical approach. Unbundling (billing separately for services that should be bundled) is considered fraudulent if done intentionally. Modifier 59 or X-modifiers can override bundling edits when procedures are truly distinct and separate.', 'A surgeon performs a tonsillectomy (CPT 42820) and adenoidectomy (CPT 42830) during the same operative session. Instead of billing both codes separately, the correct code is CPT 42821 (tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy, age under 12), which bundles both procedures. If the surgeon bills both 42820 and 42830, the claim will be denied for incorrect bundling, or one procedure will be bundled (not separately reimbursed).', 'Understanding bundling rules prevents claim denials and compliance issues. Intentional unbundling to increase reimbursement is fraud and can result in severe penalties. However, appropriate use of modifiers can enable separate payment when procedures are distinct. Practices should use NCCI edit-checking software and train coders on bundling rules.

('Medicare', 'Federal health insurance program primarily for people 65 and older, plus certain disabled individuals.', 'Medicare has four parts: Part A (hospital insurance, covers inpatient care), Part B (medical insurance, covers physician services and outpatient care), Part C (Medicare Advantage, private insurance alternative offering Parts A and B benefits), and Part D (prescription drug coverage). Medicare is the largest payer in the U.S. and sets payment standards often adopted by other payers. Medicare pays using fee schedules (physician fee schedule for Part B, IPPS for hospital inpatient, OPPS for hospital outpatient). Medicare has specific billing rules, documentation requirements, and compliance regulations. Medicare patients may have secondary insurance (Medigap, employer coverage, Medicaid). Medicare processes claims through regional MACs (Medicare Administrative Contractors).', 'A 68-year-old patient on Medicare Part B visits their doctor (covered under Part B). They also have a Medigap supplemental plan. After the visit, Medicare is billed first as primary insurance. Medicare pays 80% of the approved amount after the annual deductible is met. The claim is then automatically crossed over to the Medigap plan, which typically covers the 20% coinsurance, leaving the patient with little or no out-of-pocket cost.', 'Medicare is often the largest payer for most practices, making Medicare compliance and billing expertise critical. Medicare payment rates often set the benchmark for other payers. Medicare has extensive documentation requirements and actively audits providers. Medicare fraud and abuse enforcement is aggressive through RAC, ZPIC, and UPIC audits. Understanding Medicare rules (like the physician fee schedule, bundling edits, and documentation requirements) is essential for proper billing and compliance.', 'Insurance Terms', ARRAY['Medicare Advantage', 'Medigap', 'Fee Schedule', 'MAC']),

('Medicaid', 'Joint federal and state health insurance program for low-income individuals and families.', 'Medicaid eligibility and benefits vary by state, as each state administers its own program within federal guidelines. Medicaid covers: pregnant women, children, parents, seniors, and people with disabilities who meet income requirements. The Affordable Care Act expanded Medicaid eligibility in participating states. Medicaid is often the lowest-paying insurance, with reimbursement rates sometimes below cost of care. Some states use managed care organizations (MCOs) for Medicaid, requiring separate contracting. Medicaid billing has specific requirements varying by state. Many Medicaid patients have other insurance (Medicare, employer coverage) with Medicaid as secondary. Medicaid billing often has specific state-level rules, forms, and prior authorization requirements different from commercial payers.', 'A 6-year-old child has Medicaid coverage through their state program. When they visit the pediatrician for a well-child check, the practice verifies the child''s active Medicaid coverage, confirms the service is covered (preventive care is typically covered at 100%), provides the service, and submits the claim to the state''s Medicaid program. Payment is typically lower than commercial insurance but no patient balance is allowed (Medicaid patients cannot be balance-billed for covered services).', 'Medicaid reimbursement is often significantly lower than Medicare or commercial insurance, affecting practice finances. However, many practices serve Medicaid populations as part of their mission. Understanding state-specific Medicaid rules is essential - billing Medicaid incorrectly can result in audits and repayment demands. Some states have mandatory managed Medicaid, requiring providers to contract with specific MCOs. Medicaid billing often requires additional documentation and has longer payment cycles than commercial insurance.', 'Insurance Terms', ARRAY['Medicare', 'Managed Care', 'MCO', 'Fee-for-Service']),

('Explanation of Payment (EOP)', 'A document showing how Medicare or other payers processed and paid claims, similar to EOB but from payer to provider.', 'EOPs (also called remittance advice or RA) are sent from payers to providers explaining claim adjudication. EOPs include: claim details, service dates, procedure codes, allowed amounts, payment amounts, adjustments, patient responsibility, and remark/adjustment codes explaining claim actions. Medicare sends EOPs through Medicare Remittance Advice (MRA) - electronic version is called ERA (835 file). EOPs are essential for payment posting, identifying denials, recognizing underpayments, and reconciling bank deposits to claims. Electronic EOPs enable automated payment posting, while paper EOPs require manual entry. Providers should review EOPs line by line to identify errors, denials requiring action, and opportunities to appeal incorrect adjudications.', 'A practice receives a Medicare EOP showing 25 claims processed. Reviewing line by line shows: 20 claims paid as expected, 2 claims denied for missing information (can be corrected and resubmitted), 2 claims paid at lower amounts than expected (require investigation), and 1 claim rejected as a duplicate. The billing staff uses this EOP to: post payments, identify the 2 correctable denials for rework, research the 2 underpayments, and investigate the duplicate rejection.', 'Careful EOP review is essential for maximizing revenue and identifying issues. Many practices post payments without thorough EOP review, missing denials, underpayments, and errors. Line-by-line EOP review can identify payer errors worth appealing. Understanding adjustment codes (CARC and RARC codes) is necessary to interpret EOPs and determine appropriate follow-up actions. EOPs should be retained for compliance and audit purposes.', 'Claims & Denials', ARRAY['ERA', 'EOB', 'Remittance Advice', 'Payment Posting']);

('Encounter Form', 'A paper or electronic form listing common diagnosis and procedure codes used during patient encounters for charge capture.', 'Also called a superbill or fee ticket, encounter forms facilitate accurate charge capture by providing providers and staff with commonly used codes specific to their specialty. Forms typically include: patient demographics section, common CPT codes with descriptions, common ICD-10 codes, modifier options, and spaces for additional notes. Paper forms are marked during or after the encounter and sent to billing. Electronic forms are built into EHRs for real-time charge capture. Well-designed encounter forms improve coding accuracy, reduce missed charges, and speed billing processes. Forms should be updated annually when CPT and ICD codes change and reviewed periodically to add/remove codes based on usage patterns.', 'A family medicine practice creates an encounter form with the most common office visit codes (99202-99215), common diagnoses (hypertension, diabetes, upper respiratory infections), preventive care codes (99381-99397), and common procedures (injections, simple laceration repairs). When a provider sees a patient, they check the appropriate boxes, which are then entered into the billing system or automatically captured if using an electronic form.', 'Proper encounter form design directly impacts charge capture accuracy and completeness. Poor or outdated forms lead to missed charges, incorrect coding, and delayed billing. Electronic encounter forms integrated with EHRs enable real-time charge capture and reduce transcription errors. Encounter forms should make proper coding easy while discouraging "checkbox medicine" where inappropriate codes are selected for convenience rather than accuracy.', 'Billing Process', ARRAY['Charge Capture', 'CPT Code', 'ICD-10 Code', 'Superbill']),

('Fee Schedule', 'A complete listing of fees or charges for medical services provided by a healthcare facility or provider.', 'Fee schedules establish the prices practices charge for all services before any payer adjustments. Effective fee schedules are set above payer contracted rates to avoid leaving money on the table. Common approaches: charge a consistent percentage above Medicare (e.g., 150% of Medicare), use market-based pricing from regional data, or maintain historical charges with annual updates. Fee schedules should be reviewed annually and updated for: new codes, deleted codes, relative value changes, and market positioning. All payers see the same full fee schedule, but contracted rates (allowed amounts) vary by payer. For out-of-network claims, charges may influence payment if payers use UCR methodologies. Consistent fee schedules across all payers are required - differential pricing is prohibited by most payer contracts.', 'A practice sets its fee schedule at 180% of Medicare rates. Medicare''s rate for CPT 99214 is $110, so the practice charges $198. When billing: Medicare pays $110 (contracted rate), the practice takes an $88 adjustment. A commercial payer contracted at $145 pays that amount, with a $53 adjustment. An out-of-network payer without a contract might pay based on the $198 charge or their UCR determination.', 'Fee schedules impact revenue when new payers are contracted or for out-of-network services. Charges set too low mean negotiated rates may also be lower, directly reducing revenue. However, very high charges create large adjustment amounts that can mislead financial analysis. Fee schedule maintenance is often neglected, but annual reviews ensure practices maximize revenue opportunities. Out-of-network pricing strategies require thoughtful fee schedule management.', 'Financial Terms', ARRAY['Allowed Amount', 'Adjustment', 'UCR', 'Contracted Rate']),

('Upcoding', 'The practice of billing a higher-level service code than what was actually provided or documented.', 'Upcoding is a form of fraud where providers intentionally bill higher-level codes to receive increased reimbursement. Examples: billing a 99215 when documentation supports only 99213, billing a complex procedure when a simple version was performed, or adding units/quantities beyond what was provided. Upcoding violates the False Claims Act and can result in: payment recoupment, civil monetary penalties, criminal prosecution, exclusion from federal programs, and loss of medical license. Unintentional upcoding (due to coding errors or misunderstanding) is still problematic and can trigger audits. Conversely, downcoding (billing lower than documented) costs practices revenue but isn''t fraudulent. Proper training, documentation requirements, and internal audits prevent upcoding.', 'A provider performs a straightforward office visit with established patient addressing one stable chronic condition (appropriate code: 99213). The provider or coder bills 99215 (highest level E/M) to receive $180 instead of $110. If done knowingly and repeatedly, this constitutes upcoding fraud. If audited, the provider would face repayment demands plus penalties, and potential criminal prosecution if deemed intentional fraud.', 'Upcoding is a serious compliance risk that can destroy careers and practices. Even unintentional patterns of upcoding trigger audits, requiring practices to repay overpayments with interest and potential penalties. Documentation must support the level billed - when in doubt, bill conservatively. Regular internal audits identify coding patterns that may appear like upcoding to external auditors. Compliance training emphasizes: "code what''s documented, document what''s done."', 'Compliance & Regulations', ARRAY['Compliance', 'Fraud and Abuse', 'False Claims Act', 'Documentation']),

('Downcoding', 'When a payer reduces a claim to a lower-level code or service than what the provider billed.', 'Downcoding by payers occurs for several reasons: insufficient documentation, failure to meet criteria for billed level, bundling edits, or payer policy disagreements. Downcoding reduces reimbursement below what the provider expected. Common examples: billing 99215 but paid at 99214 level due to documentation not supporting highest level, billing bilateral procedure but paid as unilateral, or complex service paid at simple level. Downcoding can be appropriate (when provider overcoded) or inappropriate (when documentation supports billed level but payer disagrees). Inappropriate downcoding should be appealed with supporting documentation. Provider-initiated downcoding (billing lower than documentation supports) is not fraudulent but costs revenue and should be minimized through proper training.', 'A provider documents and bills CPT 99215 (highest complexity established patient visit) but the payer downcodes and pays at 99214 level, reducing payment from $180 to $140. On review, the provider finds documentation fully supports 99215 with high complexity medical decision-making and 40+ minutes total time. The provider appeals with documentation highlighting the elements supporting 99215, and the payer overturns the downcoding and pays the additional $40.', 'Downcoding by payers reduces practice revenue and should be monitored. If specific codes are routinely downcoded, either: documentation needs improvement, providers are overcoding, or payer policies require appeals. Tracking downcoding patterns by code and payer identifies targets for corrective action. Provider-initiated downcoding (billing conservatively) costs practices significant revenue - studies show many practices lose 2-5% of potential revenue due to conservative coding when documentation supports higher levels.', 'Medical Coding', ARRAY['Upcoding', 'Documentation', 'Appeal Process', 'Medical Decision Making']);
